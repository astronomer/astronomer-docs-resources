## Overview

Astronomer's [open source CLI](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli) is the easiest way to run Apache Airflow on your local machine. From the CLI, you can create a local Apache Airflow instance with a dedicated Webserver, Scheduler and Postgres Database. If you're an Astronomer customer, you can use the Astronomer CLI to create and manage users, Workspaces, Airflow Deployments, service accounts, and more.

This document contains information about all commands and settings available in the Astronomer CLI, including examples and flags. It does not contain detailed guidelines on each command, but each section provides resources for additional information in a **Related documentation** section if it's available.

## Installation

There are two ways to install any version of the Astronomer CLI:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- cURL

For a detailed changelog of all Astronomer CLI versions, see [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases).

> **Note:** Both methods only work for Unix (Linux+Mac) based systems. If you're running on Windows 10, follow [this guide](cli-install-windows-10.md) to get set up with Docker for WSL.

### Prerequisites

The Astronomer CLI installation process requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (v18.09 or higher).

### Install with Homebrew

If you have Homebrew installed, run:

```sh
brew install astro@0.27
```

### Install with cURL

To install the latest version of the Astronomer CLI, run:

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s -- v0.27.4
```

#### Note for MacOS Catalina Users:

As of macOS Catalina, Apple [replaced bash with ZSH](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651872/apple-macos-catalina-zsh-bash-shell-replacement-features) as the default shell. Our CLI install cURL command currently presents an incompatibility error with ZSH, sudo and the pipe syntax.

If you're running macOS Catalina and beyond, do the following:

1. Run `sudo -K` to reset/un-authenticate
2. Run the following to install the CLI properly:

```
curl -sSL https://install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s < /dev/null
```

### Confirm the install

To make sure that you have the Astronomer CLI installed on your machine, run:

```bash
astro version
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the version of the CLI that you installed in the output:

```
Astro CLI Version: 0.27.4
Git Commit: c4fdeda96501ac9b1f3526c97a1c5c9b3f890d71
```

For a breakdown of subcommands and corresponding descriptions, you can always run `astro` or `astro --help`.

```
astro is a command line interface for working with the Astronomer Platform.

## astro dev

This set of commands allow you to create and manage a local Airflow environment on your machine. Access to the Astronomer platform is not required.

### Usage

`astro dev <subcommand> [flags]`

Refer to the following sections for information on each subcommand.

## astro dev init

Initializes a new Airflow project in your working directory. The set of files generated by this command are required to run Airflow locally and can be deployed to an Airflow Deployment on Astronomer.

### Usage

`astro dev init [flags]`

When you run this command, the following skeleton files are generated in your current directory:

```py
.
├── dags # Where your DAGs go
│   └── example-dag.py # An example DAG that comes with the initialized project
├── Dockerfile # For Astronomer's Docker image and runtime overrides
├── include # For any other files you'd like to include
├── plugins # For any custom or community Airflow plugins
├── airflow_settings.yaml # For your Airflow Connections, Variables and Pools (local only)
├── packages.txt # For OS-level packages
└── requirements.txt # For any Python packages
```

### Options

| Option                | Value Type | Usage                                                                                              |

## astro dev kill

Forces running containers in your local Airflow environment to stop. Unlike `astro dev stop`, which only pauses running containers, `astro dev kill` deletes all data associated with your local Postgres metadata database, including Airflow Connections, logs, and task history.

This command is most often used to restart a cluster when testing new DAGs or settings in a non-production environment. After using `astro dev kill`, you can restart your environment with `astro dev start`.

### Usage

In your project directory, run `astro dev kill` to delete all data associated with your Airflow Deployment's Postgres metadata database.

## astro dev logs

Shows logs for the Scheduler or Webserver in your local Airflow environment.

### Usage

Run `astro dev logs [flags]` to start tracking logs for your Scheduler, Webserver, or Triggerer in your CLI terminal window.

### Options

| Option          | Value Type | Usage                                              |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--follow`    | None       | Continues to show the latest outputs from the log. |
| `--scheduler` | None       | Outputs only Scheduler logs.                       |
| `--webserver` | None       | Outputs only Webserver logs.                       |
| `--triggerer` | None       | Outputs only Triggerer logs.                       |

## astro dev ps

Lists all running Docker containers for your local Airflow environment. This command can only be used in a project directory and works similarly to `docker ps`.

### Usage

`astro dev ps`

## astro dev run

Runs a single [Airflow CLI command](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/cli-ref.html) on your local Airflow environment. This command only applies to local development and is not supported for Airflow Deployments on Astronomer.

### Usage

`astro dev run`

### Related documentation

| `--env` | String     | Specifies the filepath containing environment variables for the Airflow cluster. |

## astro dev stop

Stops all 3 running Docker containers on your local Airflow environment. Running this command followed by `astro dev start` is required to push certain types of changes to your Airflow project. Unlike `astro dev kill`, this command does not prune mounted volumes and will preserve data associated with your local Postgres Metadata Database.

### Usage

`astro dev stop`

## astro dev upgrade-check

Runs a script that checks whether all files in your local Airflow project are compatible with Airflow 2.0 by reviewing your DAG code, deployment-level configurations, and Environment Variables, as well as metadata from the Airflow Database. You must be on Airflow 1.10.14+ and in your Airflow project directory to run this command.
