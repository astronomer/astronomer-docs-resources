description: Manage user roles and permissions on any Astronomer Workspace and all Airflow Deployments within it.
---

## Overview

Astronomer supports a permissions and role-based access control (RBAC) framework that allows users to configure varying levels of access both at the Workspace and Airflow Deployment levels.

Workspace and Deployment-level access can each be configured with 3 user roles (_Admin_, _Editor_, _Viewer_), all of which can be set and changed via the Software UI and CLI. Each role maps to a combination of permissions to both Astronomer and Apache Airflow itself.

The guidelines below will cover:

1. How to invite users to an Astronomer Workspace and Deployment
2. How to view, set and modify user roles
3. Deployment and Workspace Permissions Reference

## Invite Users

Workspace and Deployment _Admins_ can invite and otherwise manage users both via the Software UI and CLI. All users who have access to a Workspace must be assigned 1 of 3 Workspace roles, though deployment-level roles are not required.

Read below for guidelines.

### Invite to Workspace

The ability to invite users to an Astronomer Workspace is limited to Workspace _Admins_, who can also grant the _Admin_ role to other users. Workspace _Editors_ and _Viewers_ cannot invite or otherwise manage other Workspace users, though they may do so at the deployment level depending on their deployment-level role.

A user who creates a Workspace is automatically granted the _Admin_ role for the Workspace and has the ability to create any number of Airflow Deployments within it. Every Workspace must have at least 1 Workspace _Admin_.

#### via Software UI

To invite a user to a Workspace via the Software UI, navigate to **Workspace** > **Users** > **Invite User**.

When a Workspace _Admin_ invites a user to a Workspace in which one or more Airflow Deployments exist, they'll have the opportunity to set that user's deployment-level roles as well, though it is not required.

![Invite Workspace User](/img/software/invite-user-workspace.gif)

If a Workspace Admin invites a user to a Workspace that does _not_ have any Airflow Deployments within it, the **Deployment Roles** modal above will not appear.

#### via Astronomer CLI

To invite a user to a Workspace via the Astronomer CLI, run:

```bash
astro workspace user add <email-address> --workspace-id=<workspace-id> --role=<workspace-role>
```

Only Workspace _Admins_ can invite other users and set their permissions.

To find **Workspace ID**, you can:

- Run `$ astro workspace list`
- Find it in the Workspace URL from your browser after the `/w/` (e.g. `https://app.basedomain/w/<workspace-id>`)

To set a **Role**, add a flag in the following format:

- `--WORKSPACE_EDITOR`
- `--WORKSPACE_VIEWER`
- `--WORKSPACE_ADMIN`

If you do _not_ specify a role in this command, `WORKSPACE_VIEWER` will be set by default. In all cases where a user is invited to a Workspace and deployment-level role is not specified, no deployment-level role will be assumed.

### Invite to Deployment

The ability to invite Workspace users to an Airflow Deployment within it is limited to Deployment _Admins_, who can also grant the _Admin_ role to other users. Deployment _Editors_ and _Viewers_ cannot invite or otherwise manage users. A user who creates a Deployment is automatically granted the _Admin_ role within it.

> **Note:** In order for a user to be granted access to an Airflow Deployment, they must _first_ be invited to and assigned a role within the Workspace. On the other hand, a user could be a part of a Workspace but have no access or role to any Airflow Deployments within it.

#### via Software UI

To invite a Workspace user to an Airflow Deployment via the Software UI, navigate to: **Workspace** > **Deployment** > **Access**.

From there:

1. Type the Workspace user's name in the search bar on top (or click **Show All** to view all users)
2. Select a deployment role from the drop-down menu to the right of the selected user
3. Click the `+` symbol

#### via Astronomer CLI

To invite a Workspace user to an Airflow Deployment via the Astronomer CLI, run:

```
astro deployment user add <email-address> --deployment-id=<deployment-id> --role=<deployment-role>
```

Only Deployment _Admins_ can invite other users and set their permissions.

To find **Deployment ID**, you can:

- Run `$ astro deployment list`

To set a **Role**, add a flag in the following format:

- `--DEPLOYMENT_EDITOR`
- `--DEPLOYMENT_VIEWER`
- `--DEPLOYMENT_ADMIN`

If you do _not_ specify a role in this command, `DEPLOYMENT_VIEWER` will be set by default.

## View and Edit User Roles

### Workspace

#### View Workspace Users

To view roles within a Workspace via the Software UI, navigate to **Workspace** > **Users**. All Workspace users have access to this view and can see the roles of other users.

![View Workspace Users](/img/software/view-workspace-users.png)

To list Workspace users via the Astronomer CLI, run:

```bash
astro workspace user list
```

This command will output the email addresses of all users in the Workspace alongside their ID and Workspace Role.

#### Edit Workspace User Role

If you're a Workspace _Admin_, you can edit both Workspace and deployment-level permissions by navigating to **Workspace** > **Users** and clicking into an individual user.

![Configure Access](/img/software/configure_access-0.22.png)

To edit a user's role via the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro workspace user update <email> --workspace-id=<workspace-id> --role=<workspace-role>
```

Only Workspace _Admins_ can modify the role of another user in the Workspace.

#### Remove Workspace User

Workspace _Admins_ can remove users from a Workspace by navigating to: **Workspace** > **Users** > **Individual User** > **Remove User**.

![Remove Workspace User](/img/software/remove-workspace-user.gif)

To remove a user from a Workspace via the Astronomer CLI, make sure you're first operating in that Workspace. Then, run:

```bash
astro workspace user remove <email>
```

Only Workspace _Admins_ can remove other Workspace users.

### Deployment

#### View Deployment Users

To list all users within a Deployment and their corresponding roles, navigate to **Workspace** > **Deployment** > **Access**. All Deployment users have access to this view and can see the roles of other users.

![Deployment Users](/img/software/deployment_users_0.22.png)

To list Deployment users via the Astronomer CLI, run:

```bash
astro deployment user list <deployment-id>
```

#### Edit Deployment User Role

Deployment _Admins_ can edit permissions using the dropdown menu in the **Access** tab in the Software UI.

![Configure Deployment Access](/img/software/configure-deployment-user-access.png)

To edit a user's role via the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro deployment user update <email> --deployment-id=<deployment-id> --role=<deployment-role>
```

> **Note:** A deployment-level role cannot be edited while a Workspace invitation to that user is pending. If you invite a user to a Workpace, you will not be able to modify their permissions until they accept the Workspace invite.

#### Remove Deployment User

To delete a user from an Airflow Deployment via the Software UI, Deployment _Admins_ can click on the red "wastebasket" icon within the **Access** tab shown in the screenshot above.

To delete a user from an Airflow Deployment via the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro deployment user delete <email> --deployment-id=<deployment-id>
```
