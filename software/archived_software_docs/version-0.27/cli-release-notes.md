### Improvements to the Local Development Experience

:::danger Breaking Change

The latest version of the Astronomer CLI uses Docker engine `1.13.1` to run Airflow locally via `astro dev`. If you haven't done so already, ensure that your version of Docker Engine is at least `1.13.1` before upgrading the Astronomer CLI to v0.27.2. If your Docker Engine version is `<1.13.1`, then `astro dev` commands will not work on your local machine.

:::

Astronomer CLI v0.27.2 includes several improvements to the local development experience:

- You can now run `astro dev start` with Docker Buildkit enabled. This resolves a [common issue](https://forum.astronomer.io/t/buildkit-not-supported-by-daemon-error-command-docker-build-t-airflow-astro-bcb837-airflow-latest-failed-failed-to-execute-cmd-exit-status-1/857) where users with Docker Buildkit enabled experienced an error that prevented them from running this command.
- You can now run a Triggerer in a local Airflow environment. This means that you can test DAGs that use [deferrable operators](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/deferring.html) locally before pushing them to a Deployment on Astronomer. Triggerer logs appear alongside Webserver and Scheduler logs when you run `astro dev logs`. Note that the Triggerer can run only in environments running Astronomer Certified 2.2.0+.
- The Docker containers for the Scheduler, Webserver, and Triggerer now have standard names that persist after restarting your environment. You can check the names of these containers in your local Airflow environment by running `astro dev ps`:

    ```sh
    $ astro dev ps

    Name				State		Ports
    webserver			running		8080
    triggerer			running		
    scheduler			running		
    0.27.2_a64c1a-postgres-1	running		5432
    ```

    To change the default names of these containers, run `astro config set <airflow-component>.container_name <new-component-container-name>`.

### Additional Improvements

- The Astronomer CLI can now be [installed](cli-quickstart.md) on machines with an [Apple M1 chip](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-unleashes-m1/) via both curl and Homebrew.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where you could not run an Astronomer project via `astro dev init/ astro dev start` in a directory with certain characters in the directory name
