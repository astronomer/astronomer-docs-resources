description: Manage user roles and permissions on any Astronomer Workspace and all Airflow Deployments within it.
---

## Overview

Astronomer supports a permissions and role-based access control (RBAC) framework that allows users to configure varying levels of access both at the Workspace and Airflow Deployment levels.

Workspace and Deployment-level access can each be configured with 3 user roles (_Admin_, _Editor_, _Viewer_), all of which can be set and changed via the Software UI and CLI. Each role maps to a combination of permissions to both Astronomer and Apache Airflow itself.

The guidelines below will cover:

1. How to invite users to an Astronomer Workspace and Deployment
2. How to view, set and modify user roles
3. Deployment and Workspace Permissions Reference

## Invite Users

Workspace and Deployment Admins can invite and otherwise manage users both via the Software UI and CLI. All users who have access to a Workspace must be assigned 1 of 3 Workspace roles, though deployment-level roles are not required.

Read below for guidelines.

### Invite to Workspace

The ability to invite users to an Astronomer Workspace is limited to Workspace Admins, who can also grant the Admin role to other users. Workspace Editors and Viewers cannot invite or otherwise manage other Workspace users, though they may do so at the deployment level depending on their deployment-level role.

A user who creates a Workspace is automatically granted the Admin role for the Workspace and has the ability to create any number of Airflow Deployments within it. Every Workspace must have at least 1 Workspace Admin.

#### via Software UI

To invite a user to a Workspace via the Software UI, navigate to **Workspace** > **Users** > **Invite User**.

When a Workspace Admin invites a user to a Workspace in which one or more Airflow Deployments exist, they'll have the opportunity to set that user's deployment-level roles as well, though it is not required.

![Invite Workspace User](/img/software/invite-user-workspace.gif)

If a Workspace Admin invites a user to a Workspace that has 0 Airflow Deployments, the **Deployment Roles** modal above will not appear.

#### with the Astro CLI

To invite a user to a Workspace using the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro workspace user add --email <email-address> --workspace-id <workspace-id> --role <workspace-role>
```

Only Workspace _Admins_ can invite other users and set their permissions.

To find **Workspace ID**, you can:

- Run `$ astro workspace list`
- Find it in the Workspace URL from your browser after the `/w/` (e.g. `https://app.basedomain/w/<workspace-id>`)

To set a **Role**, add a flag in the following format:

- `--WORKSPACE_EDITOR`
- `--WORKSPACE_VIEWER`
- `--WORKSPACE_ADMIN`

If you do _not_ specify a role in this command, `WORKSPACE_VIEWER` will be set by default. In all cases where a user is invited to a Workspace and deployment-level role is not specified, no deployment-level role will be assumed.

#### via Teams

You can invite a group of users from a configured third party identity provider (IDP) as a Team on your Workspace. A Team is an IDP-defined group of users who all share the same permissions to a given Deployment or Workspace.

Note that to use Teams, a System Admin must first complete the setup in [Integrate an Auth System](integrate-auth-system.md) and configure user groups as described in [Import IDP Groups](import-idp-groups.md).

To add a Team to a Workspace:

1. In the Astronomer UI, go to your Workspace and open the **Teams** tab.
2. Click **Add Team**.
3. Under **Team Name**, enter the name of your IDP group.
4. Select a **Workspace Role** for the Team. If your Workspace has existing Deployments, you can also configure the Team's permissions to those Deployments on this page:

    ![Screen for adding a Team to a Workspace](/img/software/add-team-workspace.png)

5. Click **Add**.

:::warning

If a user already exists on a Workspace before being invited via a Team, the user context with the most permissive role will be applied to the Workspace. For more information, read [Import IDP Groups](import-idp-groups.md).

### Invite to Deployment

The ability to invite Workspace users to an Airflow Deployment within it is limited to Deployment _Admins_, who can also grant the _Admin_ role to other users. Deployment _Editors_ and _Viewers_ cannot invite or otherwise manage users. A user who creates a Deployment is automatically granted the _Admin_ role within it.

> **Note:** In order for a user to be granted access to an Airflow Deployment, they must _first_ be invited to and assigned a role within the Workspace. On the other hand, a user could be a part of a Workspace but have no access or role to any Airflow Deployments within it.

#### via Software UI

To invite a Workspace user to an Airflow Deployment via the Software UI, navigate to: **Workspace** > **Deployment** > **Access**.

From there:

1. Type the Workspace user's name in the search bar on top (or click **Show All** to view all users)
2. Select a deployment role from the drop-down menu to the right of the selected user
3. Click the `+` symbol

![Invite Deployment User](/img/software/invite-user-deployment.gif)

#### with the Astro CLI

To invite a Workspace user to an Airflow Deployment using the Astro CLI, run:

```
astro deployment user add --email=<email-address> --deployment-id=<deployment-id> --role=<deployment-role>
```

Only Deployment _Admins_ can invite other users and set their permissions.

To find **Deployment ID**, you can:

- Run `$ astro deployment list`

To set a **Role**, add a flag in the following format:

- `--DEPLOYMENT_EDITOR`
- `--DEPLOYMENT_VIEWER`
- `--DEPLOYMENT_ADMIN`

If you do _not_ specify a role in this command, `DEPLOYMENT_VIEWER` will be set by default.

#### via Teams

You can invite a group of users from a configured third party identity provider (IDP) as a Team on your Deployment. A Team is an IDP-defined group of users who all share the same permissions to a given Deployment or Workspace.

Note that to use Teams, a System Admin must first complete the setup in [Integrate an Auth System](integrate-auth-system.md) and configure user groups as described in [Import IDP Groups](import-idp-groups.md).

To add a team to a Deployment:

1. In the Astronomer UI, go to your Deployment and open the **Teams** tab.
2. In the search bar that appears, search for your Team's name.
3. When your Team appears, select a Deployment-level role for the Team and click the **+** button:

    ![Screen for adding a Team to a Deployment](/img/software/add-team-deployment.png)

:::warning

If a user already exists on a Deployment before being invited via a Team, the user context with the most permissive role will be applied to the Deployment. For more information, read [Import IDP Groups](import-idp-groups.md).

## View and Edit User Roles

### Workspace

#### View Workspace Users

To view roles within a Workspace via the Software UI, navigate to **Workspace** > **Users**. All Workspace users have access to this view and can see the roles of other users.

![View Workspace Users](/img/software/view-workspace-users.png)

To list Workspace users using the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro workspace user list
```

This command will output the email addresses of all users in the Workspace alongside their ID and Workspace Role.

#### Edit Workspace User Role

If you're a Workspace _Admin_, you can edit both Workspace and deployment-level permissions by navigating to **Workspace** > **Users** and clicking into an individual user.

![Configure Access](/img/software/configure_access-0.22.png)

To edit a user's role using the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro workspace user update <email> --workspace-id=<workspace-id> --role=<workspace-role>
```

Only Workspace _Admins_ can modify the role of another user in the Workspace.

#### Remove Workspace User

Workspace _Admins_ can remove users from a Workspace by navigating to: **Workspace** > **Users** > **Individual User** > **Remove User**.

![Remove Workspace User](/img/software/remove-workspace-user.gif)

To remove a user from a Workspace via the Astro CLI, make sure you're first operating in that Workspace. Then, run:

```bash
astro workspace user remove <email>
```

Only Workspace _Admins_ can remove other Workspace users.

### Deployment

#### View Deployment Users

To list all users within a Deployment and their corresponding roles, navigate to **Workspace** > **Deployment** > **Access**. All Deployment users have access to this view and can see the roles of other users.

![Deployment Users](/img/software/deployment_users_0.22.png)

To list Deployment users via the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro deployment user list --deployment-id=<deployment-id>
```

#### Edit Deployment User Role

Deployment _Admins_ can edit permissions using the dropdown menu in the **Access** tab in the Software UI.

![Configure Deployment Access](/img/software/configure-deployment-user-access.png)

To edit a user's role using the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro deployment user update <email> --deployment-id=<deployment-id> --role=<deployment-role>
```

> **Note:** A deployment-level role cannot be edited while a Workspace invitation to that user is pending. If you invite a user to a Workpace, you will not be able to modify their permissions until they accept the Workspace invite.

#### Remove Deployment User

To delete a user from an Airflow Deployment via the Software UI, Deployment _Admins_ can click on the red "wastebasket" icon within the **Access** tab shown in the screenshot above.

To delete a user from an Airflow Deployment using the Astro CLI, run:

```bash
astro deployment user remove <email> --deployment-id=<deployment-id>
```
