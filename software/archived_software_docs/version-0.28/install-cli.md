## Overview

This guide provides instructions for how to install the Astro CLI.

The Astro CLI is the easiest way to run Apache Airflow on your machine. From the Astro CLI, you can run a local Apache Airflow environment with a dedicated Webserver, Scheduler and Postgres Database. Once you create an Astronomer Software project, you can customize it (for example, add Python or OS-level packages or add plugins) and test it on your local machine.

You can also use the CLI to:

- Authenticate to Astronomer Software.
- List the Astro Workspace and Deployments you can access.
- Deploy a project to Software.

    values={[
        {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="mac">

#### Prerequisites

To use the Astro CLI on Mac, you must have:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v18.09 or higher).

#### Installation

To install the latest supported version of the Astro CLI for Software 0.28, run the following command:

```sh
brew install astro@1.1
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

#### Prerequisites

To use the Astro CLI on Windows, you must have:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) for Windows.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v1.13.1 or higher).
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) enabled on your local machine.
-  Windows 10 or Windows 11.

#### Installation

1. Go to the [**Releases** page of the Astro CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases). Based on your desired CLI version and the CPU architecture of your machine, download one of the `.zip` files available on this page.

    For example, to install v1.1.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows machine with an AMD 64 architecture, download `astro_1.1.0-converged_windows_amd64.zip`.

2. If the `.zip` file does not automatically unzip, run the following command to unzip the executable:

    ```sh
    tar -xvzf .\astrocli.tar.gz
    ```

3. Add the filepath for the directory containing `astro.exe` as a PATH environment variable. For example, if `astro.exe` was stored in `C:\Users\username\astro.exe`, you would add `C:\Users\username` as your PATH environment variable. To learn more about configuring the PATH environment variable, see [Java documentation](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

4. Restart your machine.

## Confirm the Install

To confirm the CLI was installed properly, run the following CLI command:

```
astro version
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the following output:

<pre><code parentName="pre">{`% astro version
Astro CLI Version: {{CLI_VER_LATEST}}`}</code></pre>

## Upgrade the CLI

<Tabs
    defaultValue="mac"
    groupId= "upgrade-the-cli"
    values={[
        {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="mac">

To upgrade the Astro CLI to the latest version, run the following command:

```sh
brew install astro
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

To upgrade the Astro CLI on Windows:

1. Delete the existing `astro.exe` file on your machine.

2. Go to the [**Releases** page of the Astro CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases). Based on the version of the CLI you want and your CPU architecture, download one of the `.zip` files available in the **Assets** menu.

     For example, to upgrade to v1.0.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows machine with an AMD 64 architecture, you download `astro_1.0.0-converged_windows_amd64.zip`.

3. If the `.zip` file isn't automatically extracted, run the following command to extract the executable:

    ```sh
    tar -xvzf .\astrocli.tar.gz
    ```

4. Add the filepath for the directory containing the new `astro.exe` as a PATH environment variable. For example, if `astro.exe` was stored in `C:\Users\username\astro.exe`, you would add `C:\Users\username` as your PATH environment variable. To learn more about configuring the PATH environment variable, see [Java documentation](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

5. Restart your machine.
