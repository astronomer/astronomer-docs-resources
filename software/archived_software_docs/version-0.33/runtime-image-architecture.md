---

Astro Runtime is a production ready, data orchestration tool based on Apache Airflow that is distributed as a Docker image and is required by all Astronomer products. It provides organizations with improved functionality, reliability, efficiency, and performance.

Astro Runtime includes the following features for Astronomer Software:

- Timely support for new patch, minor, and major versions of Apache Airflow. This includes bug fixes that have not been released by the open source project but are backported to Astro Runtime and available to users earlier.
- The `astronomer-providers` package. This package is an open source collection of Apache Airflow providers and modules maintained by Astronomer. It includes deferrable versions of popular operators such as `ExternalTaskSensor`, `DatabricksRunNowOperator`, and `SnowflakeOperator`. See [Astronomer Providers documentation](https://astronomer-providers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
- A custom Airflow UI that includes links to Astronomer resources and exposes the currently running Docker image tag in the footer of all UI pages.

For more information about the features that are available in Astro Runtime releases, see the [Astro Runtime release notes](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/runtime-release-notes).

## Runtime versioning

Astro Runtime versions are released regularly and use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Astronomer ships major, minor, and patch releases of Astro Runtime in the format of `major.minor.patch`.

- **Major** versions are released for significant feature additions. This includes new major or minor versions of Apache Airflow, as well as API or DAG specification changes that are not backward compatible.
- **Minor** versions are released for functional changes. This includes API or DAG specification changes that are backward compatible, which might include new minor versions of `astronomer-providers` and `openlineage-airflow`.
- **Patch** versions are released for bug and security fixes that resolve unwanted behavior. This includes new patch versions of Apache Airflow, `astronomer-providers`, and `openlineage-airflow`.

Every version of Astro Runtime correlates to an Apache Airflow version. All Deployments must run only one version of Astro Runtime, but you can run different versions of Astro Runtime on different Deployments within a given Workspace.

For a list of supported Astro Runtime versions and more information on the Astro Runtime maintenance policy, see [Astro Runtime versioning and lifecycle policy](runtime-version-lifecycle-policy.md).

### Provider package versioning

If an Astro Runtime release includes changes to an installed version of a provider package that is maintained by Astronomer (`astronomer-providers` or `openlineage-airflow`), the version change is documented in the [Astro Runtime release notes](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/runtime-release-notes).

To determine the version of any provider package installed in your current Astro Runtime image, run:

```
docker run --rm <runtime-image> pip freeze | grep <provider>
```

## Python versioning

| Astro Runtime | Python version |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| 4             | 3.9            |
| 5             | 3.9            |
| 6             | 3.9            |
| 7             | 3.9            |
| 8             | 3.10           |
| 9             | 3.11           |
| 10            | 3.11           |

Starting with Astro Runtime 9, if you require a different version of Python than what's included in the base distribution, you can use a Python distribution of Astro Runtime. See [Distribution](#distribution).

If you're running Astro Runtime 6.0 (based on Airflow 2.4) to Runtime 8, Astronomer recommends that you use the `ExternalPythonOperator` to run different Python versions in Airflow. See [ExternalPythonOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/operator/python.html#externalpythonoperator).

If you're currently using the `KubernetesPodOperator` or the `PythonVirtualenvOperator` in your DAGs, you can continue to use them to create virtual or isolated environments that can run tasks with different versions of Python.

## Executors

In Airflow, the executor is responsible for determining how and where a task is completed.

In all local environments created with the Astro CLI, Astro Runtime runs the [Local executor](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/local.html). On Astronomer Software, you have a choice of the Celery and Kubernetes executors.

## Distribution

Astro Runtime is distributed as a Debian-based Docker image. For a list of all Astro Runtime Docker images, see [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/astronomer/astro-runtime?tab=tags).

### Base distributions

The base Astro Runtime Docker images have the following format:

- `quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<version>`
- `quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<version>-base`

An Astro Runtime image must be specified in the `Dockerfile` of your Astro project. Astronomer recommends using non-`base` images, which incorporate ONBUILD commands that copy and scaffold your Astro project directory so you can more easily pass those files to the containers running each core Airflow component. A `base` Astro Runtime image is recommended for complex use cases that require additional customization, such as [installing Python packages from private sources](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/develop-project#install-python-packages-from-private-sources).

### Python version distributions

Starting with Astro Runtime 9, Astronomer maintains different distributions Astro Runtime for each supported Python version. Python version distribution images have the following format:

```text
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<runtime-version>-python-<python-version>
```

## System distribution

The following table lists the operating systems and architectures supported by each Astro Runtime version. If you're using a Mac computer with an M1 chip, Astronomer recommends using Astro Runtime 6.0.4 or later.

| Astro Runtime | Operating System (OS)  | Architecture    |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| 4             | Debian 11.1 (bullseye) | AMD64           |
| 5             | Debian 11.3 (bullseye) | AMD64           |
| 6             | Debian 11.5 (bullseye) | AMD64 and ARM64 |
| 7             | Debian 11.5 (bullseye) | AMD64 and ARM64 |
| 8             | Debian 11.7 (bullseye) | AMD64 and ARM64 |
| 9             | Debian 11.7 (bullseye) | AMD64 and ARM64 |
| 10            | Debian 11.8 (bullseye) | AMD64 and ARM64 |

Astro Runtime 6.0.4 and later images are multi-arch and support AMD64 and ARM64 processor architectures for local development. Docker automatically uses the correct processor architecture based on the computer you are using.
