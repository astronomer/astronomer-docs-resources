description: Common snags users run into while deploying and running Astronomer Software.

If the Astronomer platform is not functioning after following the instructions in the installation guide for any specific environment, here are a few things to try:

## Houston, Grafana, and Prisma stuck in CrashLoopBackOff

When deploying the base Astronomer platform, the only three pods that will connect directly to the database are Houston (API), Grafana, and Prisma. All other database connections will be created from Airflow deployments created on Astronomer.

```
$ kubectl get pods -n astro-demo

If these are the only three pods that are not coming up as healthy, it is usually indicative of an issue with connecting to the database. Try checking:

#### Networking
Make sure that the Kubernetes cluster Astronomer is running on can connect to the database. One way to check this is to jump into an Astronomer pod and try connecting directly to the database:

```
kubectl exec -it manageable-snail-houston-6fb7956994-2tngn /bin/sh -n astro-demo
```

Once inside the pod, add the `postgresql` package:

```
/houston # apk add postgresql
fetch https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.10/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
fetch https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.10/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz

```

Now try connecting with `psql`:

```
/houston # psql -U <username> -h <host> -p <port>
Password for user <username>:

```
If the connection times out here, there may be a networking issue.

#### Verify the Secret
Check to make sure the `astronomer-bootstrap` secret created earlier, which contains the connection string to the database, does not contain any typos:

```
$ kubectl get secrets -n astro-demo

manageable-snail-registry-auth                         kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson        1      33h
```

To decrypt the `astronomer-bootstrap` secret:

```
$ kubectl get secret astronomer-bootstrap -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  connection: <encoded_value>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-12-27T16:57:42Z"
  name: astronomer-bootstrap
  namespace: astro-demo
  resourceVersion: "37526902"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/astro-demo/secrets/astronomer-bootstrap
  uid: ff0ed7a4-28c9-11ea-87af-4201ac100003
type: Opaque
```

Now to see the secret in plaintext:
```
echo <encoded_value> | base64 --decode
```

If there is indeed a typo, delete the secret, recreate it with the right value, and then delete all the pods in the namespace.

```
$ kubectl delete secret astronomer-bootstrap -n astro-demo
secret/astronomer-bootstrap deleted
$ kubectl create secret generic astronomer-bootstrap --from-literal connection="<your_connection_string>" --namespace <namespace>
secret/astronomer-bootstrap created
$ kubectl delete --all pods --namespace <namespace>
```

Restarting the pods will force them to pick up the new value.
