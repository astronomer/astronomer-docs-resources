---

The Astronomer [open source CLI](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli) is the easiest way to run Apache Airflow on your local machine. From the CLI, you can create a local Apache Airflow instance with a dedicated Webserver, Scheduler and Postgres Database. If you're an Astronomer customer, you can use the Astro CLI to create and manage users, Workspaces, Airflow Deployments, service accounts, and more.

This document contains information about all commands and settings available in the Astro CLI, including examples and flags. It does not contain detailed guidelines on each command, but each section provides resources for additional information in a **Related documentation** section if it's available.

## Installation

To install the CLI, see [Install the CLI](install-cli.md)

### Prerequisites

The Astro CLI installation process requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (v18.09 or higher).

### Install with Homebrew

If you have Homebrew installed, run:

```sh
brew install astro
```

### Install with cURL

To install the latest version of the Astro CLI, run:

```
curl -sSL https://install.astronomer.io | sudo bash
```

#### Note for MacOS Catalina Users:

As of macOS Catalina, Apple [replaced bash with ZSH](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651872/apple-macos-catalina-zsh-bash-shell-replacement-features) as the default shell. Our CLI install cURL command currently presents an incompatibility error with ZSH, sudo and the pipe syntax.

If you're running macOS Catalina and beyond, do the following:

1. Run `sudo -K` to reset/un-authenticate
2. Run the following to install the CLI properly:

```
curl -sSL https://install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s < /dev/null
```

### Confirm the install

To make sure that you have the Astro CLI installed on your machine, run:

```bash
astro version
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the version of the CLI that you installed in the output:

```
Astro CLI Version: 1.2.0
Git Commit: c4fdeda96501ac9b1f3526c97a1c5c9b3f890d71
```

For a breakdown of subcommands and corresponding descriptions, you can always run `astro` or `astro --help`.

```

## astro completion

Generates autocompletion scripts for Astronomer.

### Usage

Use `astro completion <subcommand>` to generate autocompletion scripts, which can be used to automate workflows on Astronomer that require multiple CLI commands.

> **Note:** If you're running on MacOS, make sure to install [Bash Completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) before creating autocompletion scripts. To do so via Homebrew, run:

    ```sh
    brew install bash-completion
    ```

## astro context delete

Delete the locally stored information for a given Astronomer installation. After running this command, the domain for the installation that you specify no longer appears when you run `astro context list`, and you can't use the `astro context switch` command to move to the installation.

If you use this command to reauthenticate to an installation that you previously deleted, installation information is available when you use the `astro context list` and `astro context switch` commands.

### Usage

```sh
astro context delete <basedomain>
```

## astro context list

View a list of domains for all Astronomer installations that you have access to. Astronomer installations appear on this list if you have authenticated to it at least once using `astro login`.

### Usage

```sh
astro context list
```

## astro context switch

Switch to a different Astronomer installation. You can switch to a given Astronomer installation if you have authenticated to it at least once using `astro login`.

After you switch to a different Astronomer installation, you might need to run `astro login` to reauthenticate to the installation.

### Usage

```sh
astro context switch <basedomain>
```

## astro deploy

Deploys code in your Airflow project directory to any Airflow Deployment on Astronomer.

### Usage

Run `astro deploy <your-deployment-release-name> [flags]` in your terminal to push a local Airflow project as a Docker image to your Airflow Deployment on Astronomer.

If you have the appropriate Workspace and Deployment-level permissions, your code is packaged into a Docker image, pushed to Astronomer's Docker Registry, and applied to your Airflow webserver, scheduler(s), and worker(s).

To identify your Deployment's release name, go to **Settings** > **Basics** > **Release Name** in the Software UI or run `astro deployment list`.

If you run `astro deploy` without specifying `your-deployment-release-name`, the Astro CLI lists all Airflow Deployments in your Workspace.
