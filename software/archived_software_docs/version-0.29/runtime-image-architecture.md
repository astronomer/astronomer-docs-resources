description: Reference documentation for Astro Runtime, a differentiated distribution of Apache Airflow.
---

Astro Runtime is a production ready data orchestration tool based on Apache Airflow that is distributed as a Docker image. It is intended to provide organizations with improved functionality, reliability, efficiency, and performance.

Astro Runtime includes the following features:

- Timely support for new patch, minor, and major versions of Apache Airflow. This includes bug fixes that have not been released by the open source project but are backported to Astro Runtime and available to users earlier.
- The `astronomer-providers` package. This package is an open source collection of Apache Airflow providers and modules maintained by Astronomer. It includes deferrable versions of popular operators such as `ExternalTaskSensor`, `DatabricksRunNowOperator`, and `SnowflakeOperator`. See [Astronomer deferrable operators](deferrable-operators.md#astronomer-deferrable-operators).
- The `openlineage-airflow` package. [OpenLineage](https://openlineage.io/) standardizes the definition of data lineage, the metadata that forms lineage metadata, and how data lineage metadata is collected from external systems. See [OpenLineage and Airflow](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-openlineage/).
- A custom security manager that enforces user roles and permissions as defined by Astronomer. See [Manage user permissions on Astronomer Software](workspace-permissions.md).

For more information about the features that are available in Astro Runtime releases, see the [Astro Runtime release notes](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/runtime-release-notes).

## Runtime versioning

Astro Runtime versions are released regularly and use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Astronomer ships major, minor, and patch releases of Astro Runtime in the format of `major.minor.patch`.

- **Major** versions are released for significant feature additions. This includes new major or minor versions of Apache Airflow as well as API or DAG specification changes that are not backwards-compatible.
- **Minor** versions are released for functional changes. This includes API or DAG specification changes that are backwards-compatible.
- **Patch** versions are released for bug and security fixes that resolve unwanted behavior. This includes new patch versions of Apache Airflow, `astronomer-providers`, and `openlineage-airflow`.

Every version of Astro Runtime correlates to an Apache Airflow version. All Deployments on Astronomer Software must run only one version of Astro Runtime, but you can run different versions of Astro Runtime on different Deployments within a given cluster or Workspace. See [Create a Deployment](configure-deployment.md#create-a-deployment).

For a list of supported Astro Runtime versions and more information on the Astro Runtime maintenance policy, see [Astro Runtime versioning and lifecycle policy](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/runtime-version-lifecycle-policy).

### Astro Runtime and Apache Airflow parity

This table lists Astro Runtime releases and their associated Apache Airflow versions.

| Astro Runtime | Apache Airflow version |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| 4.1.x         | 2.2.4                  |
| 4.2.x         | 2.2.4-2.2.5            |
| 5.0.x         | 2.3.0-2.3.4            |
| 5.0.x         | 2.4.0                  |

:::info
Each Runtime version in a given minor series supports only a single version of Apache Airflow. For specific version compatibility information, see [Runtime release notes](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/runtime-release-notes).

## Provider packages

All Astro Runtime images have the following open source provider packages pre-installed:

- Amazon [`apache-airflow-providers-amazon`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/)
- Apache Hive [`apache-airflow-providers-apache-hive`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-apache-hive/)

### Provider package versioning

If an Astro Runtime release includes changes to an installed version of a provider package that is maintained by Astronomer (`astronomer-providers` or `openlineage-airflow`), the version change is documented in the [Astro Runtime release notes](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/runtime-release-notes).

To determine the version of any provider package installed in your current Astro Runtime image, run:

```
docker run --rm {image} pip freeze | grep <provider>
```

## Python versioning

Astro Runtime supports Python 3.9. This is the only version of Python that Astro Runtime supports. If your data pipelines require an unsupported Python version, Astronomer recommends that you use the KubernetesPodOperator. See [Run the KubernetesPodOperator on Astronomer Software](kubepodoperator.md).

## Executors

In Airflow, the executor is responsible for determining how and where a task is completed.

In all local environments created with the Astro CLI, Astro Runtime runs the [Local executor](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/local.html). On Software Depolyments, Astro Runtime is compatible with the [Celery executor](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/celery.html) and [Kubernetes executor](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/kubernetes.html)

Soon, Astronomer will provide a new executor with intelligent worker packing, task-level resource requests, improved logging, and Kubernetes-like task isolation.

## Distribution

Astro Runtime is distributed as a Debian-based Docker image. Runtime Docker images have the following format:

- `quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<version>`
- `quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<version>-base`

An Astro Runtime image must be specified in the `Dockerfile` of your Astro project. Astronomer recommends using non-`base` images, which incorporate ONBUILD commands that copy and scaffold your Astro project directory so you can more easily pass those files to the containers running each core Airflow component. A `base` Astro Runtime image is recommended for complex use cases that require additional customization, such as [installing Python packages from private sources](customize-image#install-python-packages-from-private-sources).

For a list of all Astro Runtime Docker images, see [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/astronomer/astro-runtime?tab=tags).

## System distribution

Astro Runtime images are based on Debian 11.3 (bullseye).
