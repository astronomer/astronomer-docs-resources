This document contains release notes for each version of Astronomer Software.

Version 0.34 is the latest long-term support (LTS) version of Astronomer Software. To upgrade to version 0.34, see [Upgrade Astronomer](upgrade-astronomer.md). For more information about Software release channels, see [Release and lifecycle policies](release-lifecycle-policy.md). To read release notes specifically for the Astro CLI, see [Astro CLI release notes](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/release-notes).

:::info 

Because Astronomer has separate [maintenance life cycles](release-lifecycle-policy.md) for each minor version of Astronomer Software, the same change can be introduced multiple times across minor versions, resulting in multiple identical release notes. When a new minor version releases, such as version 0.33.0, all changes from previously released versions are included in the new minor version.

If you're upgrading to receive a specific change, ensure the release note for the change appears either:

- Within your target minor version.
- In a patch version that was released before the first release of your target minor version. For example, a change in 0.32.5, which released 12/8/2023, is not guaranteed to appear in the 0.33 series, which released 9/8/2023, unless there is a release note for it in an 0.33 patch. However, all changes in 0.32.1, which released June 12, 2023, are guaranteed to be in the 0.33 series, because 0.32.1 was released before 0.33.0.

:::

## 0.34.1

Release date: April 8, 2024

### Documentation refactor

- To make the documentation more consistent with Helm standards, all instances of `config.yaml` have been replaced with `values.yaml`.

### Additional improvements

- NGinx now has a dedicated service account with only the required permissions for the service
- You can now specify an image pull secret for the `privateCaCertsAddToHost.certCopier` image so that you can pull the image from a private registry.
- Added support for [Kubernetes 1.29](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/).
- You can now define `additionalScrapeJobs` in the Prometheus Helm chart so that Prometheus scrapes additional jobs on the Astronomer Software cluster. For example, you could add the following configuration to `values.yaml` to scrape a static job:

    ```yaml
    astronomer:
    prometheus:
    additionalScrapeJobs:
    - job_name: example-static-job
      static_configs:
      - targets:
        - localhost:9090
    ```

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the value for `houston.config.deployments.resourceProvisioningStrategy.astroUnitsEnabled` was not respected when creating Deployments using the Houston API.
- Fixed an issue where skipping multiple pages of a list in the Software UI could skip an extra page.
- Removed support for Kubernetes 1.24.
- Fixed an issue where task usage metrics didn't work when using a private certificate authority.
- Resolved the following vulnerabilities:

## 0.34.0

Release date: February 12, 2024

### Updated permissions for upgrading Deployments to unsupported Astro Runtime versions

:::danger Breaking change

This update includes a breaking change to the Astronomer Software Helm chart. The setting `enableSystemAdminCanUseAllRuntimes` no longer exists and has been replaced with:

```yaml
astronomer:
   houston:
      config:
         deployments:
            enableListAllRuntimeVersions: true   
```

This new setting changes whether all Admin-level users can view and upgrade to deprecated versions of Astro Runtime from the Software UI.

:::

By default, any user with an Admin-level role (Deployment Admin, Workspace Admin, System Admin) can now upgrade a Deployment to an unsupported version of Astro Runtime using the Astro CLI and the Houston API. 

You can additionally set the following value in your `values.yaml` file to enable these users to view and upgrade to unsupported Runtime versions through the Software UI:

```yaml
astronomer:
   houston:
      config:
         deployments:
            enableListAllRuntimeVersions: true   
```

### Change resource provisioning strategy per Deployment

You can now set a **Resource Strategy** for each Deployment to fine-tune how Astronomer Software reserves resources for the Deployment within the cluster. The new resource strategies don't use AUs, meaning you can specify the exact CPU/ Memory requests and limits based on the needs of the Deployment. For example, you can configure a Deployment to have significantly more memory than CPU in extra capacity so that memory-intensive tasks are always guaranteed to run. See [Customize resource usage](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/software/customize-resource-usage) for more information.

### Deploy only DAGs with `astro deploy -â€”dags`

You can now deploy only the DAGs folder of an Astro project to a Deployment. If you only need to deploy DAG code changes, DAG-only deploys are faster and safer than a full image deploy. This also allows you to configure CI/CD pipelines that allow certain team members to only push DAGs, while allowing other team members to push Astro project configuration updates. See [Deploy DAGs](deploy-dags.md) for more information.

### Additional improvements

- You can now configure a global label that is applied to all Astronomer Software Pods.
- You can now filter on `release_name` when you make a `deployments()` query to the Houston API.
- You can now use containerd-based Astro Runtime images on an Astronomer Software cluster with a self-managed private CA certificate. To configure a self-managed private CA certificate, add the following configuration to your `values.yaml` file and apply the configuration to your cluster:

    ```yaml
    astronomer:
      privateCaCertsAddToHost:
        enabled: true
        hostDirectory: /path/to/docker/certs.d
        addToContainerd: false
        containerdCertConfigPath: /path/to/containerd/certs.d
        containerdConfigToml: ~
        containerdnodeAffinitys: []
    ```

- You can now make a `createDeployment` or `upsertDeployment` query by specifying a Workspace name or label instead of a Workspace ID.
- You can now disable the `astro-cli` Pod to free up resources on your cluster. This Pod is typically only used in airgapped clusters that can't access `https://install.astronomer.io`. To disable the Pod, add the following configuration to your `values.yaml` file and apply the change to your cluster:

    ```yaml
    astronomer:
      install:
        cli-enabled: true
    ```

- Astronomer Software now redeploys your Deployment when you switch your executor type.
- You no longer have to manually define your private registry in the configuration for [Vector logging sidecars.](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/software/export-task-logs#customize-vector-logging-sidecars).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where Astronomer users would occasionally not be associated with their related Azure AD/ Microsoft Entra ID accounts when added to Astronomer using SCIM.
- The Houston API now validates `updateDeployment` queries to ensure that Deployment resource limits and requests are set correctly.
- Fixed an issue where the **Core Container Status** section of the **Metrics** tab would occasionally show unhealthy containers with a healthy status.  
- Fixed an issue where Deployments would occasionally not recreate the correct resources when switching from the Kubernetes executor to the Celery executor.
- Fixed an issue where deploys could fail when using a self-signed certificate signed by a private certificate authority.
- Fixed an issue where Deployments would not have default configuration values as expected when a configuration was missing.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't search for a user in the Software UI by their user ID.
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

## 0.33.3

Release date: January 19, 2024

### Additional improvements 

- Added support for [Kubernetes 1.29](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the Workspace list page in the Software UI would show an error if any Workspace had an empty description.
- Fixed an issue in 0.33.2 where you couldn't migrate a Deployment from Astronomer Certified to Astro Runtime. 
- Fixed an issue where a Deployment would incorrectly appear as unhealthy if you scaled down its number of triggerers to zero.
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

    - [CVE-2023-2253](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2253)
    - [CVE-2023-37788](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37788)
    - [GHSA-fr2g-9hjm-wr23](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fr2g-9hjm-wr23)
   
## 0.33.2 

Release date: November 20, 2023

### Change to behavior for interacting with deprecated Runtime versions

In 0.33.2, non-System Admin users can now update Deployments using deprecated versions of Astro Runtime. By default, non-System Admin users can now interact with Deployments using deprecated Runtime versions, but only System Admins can create new Deployments with deprecated Runtime versions. As a result of this change, the `enableSystemAdminCanUseNonSupportedRuntime` key has been replaced with `enableSystemAdminCanUseAllRuntimes`. To set the new flag, add the following configuration to your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
astronomer:
   houston:
      config:
         deployments:
            enableSystemAdminCanUseAllRuntimes: true   
```

### Additional improvements

- You can now configure a global index name prefix to use for both Fluentd and sidecar-based logging, which allows Astronomer Software to retain logs when you migrate between logging solutions. To enable this feature, add the following lines to your `values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    global:
       logging:
          indexNamePrefix: <your-index-prefix>
    ```
- Deprecated Kubernetes 1.23

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where deploys were failing for Deployments that used older versions of the Airflow Helm chart.
- Fixed an issue where some dashboards in Grafana were not visible if you didn't manually log in to Grafana as an admin.
- Fixed an issue where the Software UI showed Deployments as healthy even if the triggerer Pod was down.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't search for a user in the Software UI by their user ID.
- Fixed an issue where the `invites` query returned an error instead of an empty array when no users invites were found.
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

## 0.33.1

Release date: October 13, 2023

### Additional improvements

- You can now set `astronomer.auth.microsoft.useExternalProxy: false` in your `values.yaml` file to bypass proxy support for Azure logins.
- You can now list System-level Service Accounts using the Houston API.
- You can now configure a service account specifically for your image registry using by setting `astronomer.registry.serviceaccount` in your `values.yaml` file.
- The Kibana logging dashboard now includes a default index. 

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where if you queried a Deployment name that belonged to two different Deployments in two different Workspaces, the Houston API might retrieve the unintended Deployment. 
- Fixed an issue where you could create users with the Houston API when SCIM was enabled and `userManagement.enable` was `false`.
- Fixed an issue where some dashboards on Grafana didn't load properly.
- Fixed an issue where the Houston API `CreateDeployment` request would return a successful response even though no Deployment was created due to no specified Airflow version.
- Fixed an issue where a System Admin user that did not belong to a Team could delete the Team from the Software UI.
- Fixed an issue where syncing an IdP group from Okta failed when SCIM was enabled and a user account was removed only from Astronomer Software.
- Fixed an issue where adding a user through SCIM provisioning that already exists on an Astronomer Software Azure cluster would throw an error instead of updating the existing user.
- Fixed an issue where the user login process would be unresponsive if the Houston API failed to retrieve IdP group information from Azure.
- Fixed an issue where the Software UI would show Deployments as healthy even when triggerer Pods were failing.
- Fixed an issue where a user who was deleted from Astronomer Software would not appear when they were reinvited through a Team.
- Fixed an issue where the System Admin page in the Software UI had entries that didn't fit the page.
- Astronomer Software now throws an error if you attempt to install it with an unsupported version of Kubernetes.
- Fixed an issue where using the Houston API to query for a Deployment that didn't exist returned a non-descriptive error.
- Fixed an issue where `ap-blackbox-exporter` did not respect global network policies.
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

## 0.33.0

Release date: September 8, 2023

### Automatic PGBouncer connection scaling

Astronomer Software can now automatically scale the size of PGBouncer connection pools based on your Airflow component counts and Airflow configuration, instead of solely based on total AU. This improves performance, scalability, and utilization of database connections across all Deployments. 

This feature is off by default. You can enable it by setting  `deployments.pgBouncerResourceCalculationStrategy: airflowStratV2` in your `values.yaml` file. To revert back to previous behavior, set this key to `auStratV1` instead.

### Additional improvements

- You can now disable Airflow and platform alerts on the Prometheus alerts dashboard by setting `prometheus.defaultAlerts.airflow.enabled` and `prometheus.defaultAlerts.airflow.enabled` to `false` in your Prometheus Helm chart. If you disable these alerts, you can still add back specific alerts or configure custom alerts using `prometheus.defaultAlerts.additionalAlerts`. See [Create custom alerts](platform-alerts.md#create-custom-alerts).
- Added support for [Kubernetes 1.27](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/).
- The Workspace **Deployments** page is now paginated in the Astronomer UI.
- The **Extra Capacity** field in the Astronomer UI now shows up to 6 digits of AU.
- You no longer have to set `elasticsearch.curator.age.timestring` when you configure a custom indexing pattern for [Vector logging sidecars](export-task-logs.md#export-logs-using-container-sidecars). The only required value is now `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.helm.loggingSidecar.indexPattern`.
- When you create or update a Deployment and select a Runtime version, the Astronomer UI now shows only the latest supported Astro Runtime patch for each supported Astro Runtime major version.
- You can now set `deployments.canUpsertDeploymentFromUI: false` to prevent all users besides System Admins from updating Deployments and environment variables through the Astronomer UI.
- You can now overprovision the `triggerer-log-groomer` component.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where a Deployment using Runtime 8 or earlier with the Celery executor would show as healthy in the Software UI even when workers were unavailable.
- Fixed an issue where Grafana could not start up on an OpenShift cluster.
- Fixed an issue where configurations in `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.components` applied only to Deployments that were created after the configuration was set. 
- Fixed an issue where a Workspace-level service account would improperly inherit lesser permissions for Deployments it was added to.
- The Astronomer UI now shows an error if you click the **Delete** button for Teams and you don't have the `system.teams.remove` permission.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't upgrade a Deployment's Airflow version if the Deployment used git-sync deploys and had default resources.
- Fixed an issue where you could get a 500 internal server error from the Airflow UI when switching between pages for a DAG.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't set `properties.email` using the `upsertDeployment` mutation.
- Fixed an issue where the Astronomer UI would not show the right error screen when a user without the appropriate permissions viewed service accounts. 
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

    - [CVE-2023-35945](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-35945)
    - [CVE-2023-37920](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-37920)

### Additional improvements

- Added support for [Kubernetes 1.29](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md)
- You no longer have to manually define your private registry in the configuration for [Vector logging sidecars.](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/software/export-task-logs#customize-vector-logging-sidecars). Your registry details are now automatically pulled from your core private registry configuration. 
- Fixed an issue where container status and usage did not appear in the **Metrics** tab for Deployments with pre-created namespaces.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where Deployments would not have default configuration values as expected when a configuration was missing.
- Fixed an issue where the **Core Container Status** section of the **Metrics** tab would occasionally show unhealthy containers with a healthy status.  
- Fixed an issue where a Deployment would incorrectly appear as unhealthy if you scaled down its number of triggerers to zero.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't specify an image pull secret for the `certCopier` image, meaning that you couldn't pull it from a private registry.
- Resolved the following vulnerabilities:

## 0.32.5

Release date: December 8, 2023

### Additional improvements

- You can now configure a global index name prefix to use for both [Fluentd and sidecar-based logging](export-task-logs.md), which allows Astronomer Software to retain logs when you migrate between logging solutions. To enable this feature, add the following lines to your `values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    global:
      logging:
        indexNamePrefix: <your-index-prefix>
    ```
    
- Deprecated Kubernetes 1.23.
- Astronomer Software now throws an error if you attempt to install it with an unsupported version of Kubernetes.
- You can now set the following configuration to bypass proxy support when Astronomer Software redirects to Azure login. This might be required in some circumstances when importing identity provider groups as Teams: 

    ```yaml
    astronomer:
      houston:
        config:
          auth:
            microsoft:
              useExternalProxy: false
    ```

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where deleting a user from Astronomer Software without deleting the user from an Idp Team could result in the user not being active if they're re-added.
- Fixed an issue that allowed user creation with the Houston API when SCIM was enabled and `userManagement.enable` was `false`.
- Fixed an issue where the Software UI showed Deployments as healthy even if the triggerer Pod was down.
- Fixed an issue where using the Houston API to query for a Deployment that didn't exist returned a non-descriptive error.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't update the value for an existing secret environment variable.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't search for a user in the Software UI by their user ID.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't access Grafana or Kibana on GKE V2 clusters.
- Fixed an issue where the `invites` query returned an error instead of an empty array when no users invites were found.

## 0.32.3

Release date: August 31, 2023

### Additional improvements

- You can now disable Airflow and platform alerts on the Prometheus alerts dashboard by setting `Values.defaultAlerts.airflow.enabled` and `prometheus.defaultAlerts.platform.enabled` to `false` in your Prometheus Helm chart. If you disable these alerts, you can still add back specific alerts or configure custom alerts using `prometheus.defaultAlerts.additionalAlerts`. See [Create custom alerts](platform-alerts.md#create-custom-alerts).
- You no longer have to set `elasticsearch.curator.age.timestring` when you configure a custom indexing pattern for [Vector logging sidecars](export-task-logs.md#export-logs-using-container-sidecars). The only required value is now `global.loggingSidecar.indexPattern`.
- You can now configure a service account specifically for your image registry using by setting `astronomer.registry.serviceaccount` in your `values.yaml` file.
- You can now overprovision the `triggerer-log-groomer` component.
- You can now set `astronomer.houston.enableHoustonInternalAuthorization` in your `values.yaml` file to redirect all authorization requests from the ingress controller to the Houston API internal service endpoint. This can increase performance and decrease network latency.

## 0.32.1

Release date: June 12, 2023

### Additional improvements

- Overprovisioning now also applies to the following components:

    - PGBouncer
    - Statsd
    - Flower
  
- You can now configure `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.overProvisioningComponents` to limit the scope of overprovisioning only to specific Airflow components.
- Teams without any users are now automatically deleted when SCIM is disabled.
- You can now authenticate to an external storage service for [archiving task metadata](configure-deployment.md#clean-deployment-task-metadata) using Workload Identity.
- You can now set `prometheus.config.scrape_configs.kubernetes_apiservers.tls_config.insecure_skip_verify` in the Prometheus Helm chart.
- You can now set `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.helm.prometheus.certgenerator.extraAnnotations` in your `values.yaml` file.
- You can now configure credentials for a registry backend as Kubernetes secrets in your `values.yaml` file. See [Configure a registry backend](registry-backend.md).

    - [CVE-2023-2650](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-2650)

## 0.32.0

Release date: April 28, 2023

### Clean Deployment task metadata

You can now clean task data from your Deployments by exporting it to an external storage service. This workflow reduces the amount of data Airflow stores in your Deployment metadata database by archiving data that you don't need to access on a regular basis. To configure this job, see [Clean Deployment task metadata](configure-deployment.md#clean-deployment-task-metadata).

### Programmatically create and update Deployments with the Houston API

You can now programmatically create or update Deployments using the Houston API `upsertDeployment` mutation. Unlike `createDeployment`, the `upsertDeployment` mutation includes keys for configuring Deployment resources such as environment variables. See [Create or update a Deployment with configurations](houston-api.md#create-or-update-a-deployment-with-configurations).

### Reduce resource requests for Airflow components in development environments

You can reduce the amount of CPU and memory that an Airflow component requests in development environments, allowing you to more efficiently provision resources based on the requirements for your development Deployments.

### New cron job to clean Deployment task data

You can now clean task data from your Deployments by exporting it to an external storage service. This workflow reduces the amount of storage Astronomer Software uses by archiving data that you don't need to access on a regular basis. See [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment.md#clean-deployment-task-metadata) for configuration steps.

### Assign System-level permissions to Teams

You can assign the System Admin, System Editor, and System Viewer permissions to teams by setting the following values in your `values.yaml` file:

```sh
# Auth configuration.
auth:
  openidConnect:
    idpGroupsImportEnabled: true
    # Optional configuration. Set to assign System-level permissions using Teams.
    manageSystemPermissionsViaIdpGroups:
      enabled: true
      systemAdmin: ["<your-system-admin-groups>"] // Only these groups will be treated as SysAdmin Groups
      systemEditor: ["<your-system-editor-groups>"]
      systemViewer: ["<your-system-viewer-groups>"]
```

When coupled with [disabling individual user management](import-idp-groups.md#disable-individual-user-management), this feature allows you to control all user permissions on Astronomer Software exclusively through your identity provider. For more information, see [Import IdP groups](import-idp-groups.md).

### PostgreSQL 15

Astronomer Software version 0.32 upgrades PostgreSQL from 11.18.0-1 to 15. If you use in-cluster PostgreSQL for your workflows, upgrading to Software 0.32 without pinning your PostgreSQL version can impact your workflows. See the [Upgrade to Postgres 15](upgrade-astronomer.md#upgrade-to-postgres-15) for upgrade considerations and steps.

### Additional improvements

- Added support for using git-sync with a private image registry.
- The root user feature introduced in Astronomer Software version 0.31 has been deprecated. System Admins now have the highest level of permissions on the platform.
- Workspaces are now required to have unique names. If you have existing Workspaces with identical names, upon upgrade the duplicate names will be appended with an underscore and a number.
- If you configured [git-sync deploys](deploy-git-sync.md) for a Deployment, you can now [view error logs](deployment-logs.md) emitted from the git-sync Kubernetes Pod in the Software UI.
- You can now configure a custom indexing pattern for [Vector logging sidecars](export-task-logs.md#export-logs-using-container-sidecars) by setting both `elasticsearch.curator.age.timestring` and `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.helm.loggingSidecar.indexPattern` in your `values.yaml` file.
- You can now configure custom environment variables for ElasticSearch-based custom logging using the `astronomer.customLogging.extraEnv` value in your `values.yaml` file.
- The `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.sysAdminScalabilityImprovementsEnabled` key has been replaced with `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.performanceOptimizationModeEnabled`  for improved performance across additional Software UI views.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where ElasticSearch Curator version 7 and later did not work as expected.
- Fixed an issue where sidecar containers would sometimes not terminate properly after their primary container was terminated.
- Fixed an issue in the Software UI where you could not view Deployment details for a Deployment that included "team" in its name.
- Fixed an issue where a service account with Workspace Editor permissions could update Deployments. 
- Fixed an issue where Prometheus was using more memory than expected due to a misconfiguration of statsd.
Fixed an issue in the Software UI where a text search returned duplicate entries for a single Deployment name.
- Fixed an issue where authentication tokens were visible in Nginx logs produced by the Software UI.
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

## 0.31.0

Release date: December 7, 2022

### View and export task usage metrics

You can now view task usage metrics from the Software UI.

Task usage metrics provide an overview of your Airflow task runs and can help you quickly identify Deployments where more tasks are running or failing than expected. 

To configure the feature, see [Set up task usage metrics](task-usage-metrics.md).

### New root user role

Astronomer Software's role-based access control (RBAC) system now supports a single root user for each installation. The root user has a non-configurable username and autogenerated password stored as a Kubernetes secret in your installation. 

See [Manage the root user](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/software/0.31/manage-root-user#log-in-as-the-root-user).

### Manage Astronomer users through a SCIM integration 

Astronomer Software now supports managing users through System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM), which allows you to automatically provision and deprovision users based on templates for access and permissions. See [Manage users with SCIM](integrate-auth-system.md#manage-users-and-teams-with-scim).

### Invite users only through Teams

Using the new root user feature, you can now configure Astronomer Software so that users are managed exclusively through Teams. This helps you better integrate with your identity provider (IdP) by ensuring that all users on your platform are authenticated and managed through the IdP. See [Disable individual user management](import-idp-groups.md#disable-individual-user-management).

### New default resource limits and requests 

Astronomer Software 0.31 includes new default resource limits and requests on the following resources: 

- Alertmanager
- Elasticsearch
- NATS
- PostrgeSQL
- STAN
- Nginx
- Grafana
- Blackbox exporter

You might experience OOMKill errors or unexpected behavior after upgrading if you use resources beyond the new default limits. To minimize disruption, view resource usage for these components in [Grafana](grafana-metrics.md) prior to upgrade and compare this usage to the default resource limits in the [Astronomer Helm chart](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer/blob/master/charts/astronomer/values.yaml). 

If your current usage is expected and higher than the default resource limits, update the limits in your `values.yaml` file before upgrading to Astronomer Software 0.31.

### Additional improvements 

- You can now set a custom security context for `es-client` by setting `elasticsearch.client.securityContext.capabilities.add={}` in the ElasticSearch Helm chart.
- The **Deployment users** page is now paginated in the Software UI.
- You can now set `astronomer.registry.logLevel` to filter which types of logs appear in your Docker registry.
- The default Git-sync interval is now 1 instead of 0.
- You can now configure a Deployment to have 0 triggerer components.
- You can now set `astronomer.houston.config.useAutoCompleteForSensativeFields=false` to disable autocomplete on sensitive fields in the Software UI.
- You can now set `astronomer.houston.config.shouldLogUsername=true` to include user email addresses in audit logs for logins through the Houston API.
- [Git sync-based Deployments](deploy-git-sync.md) now have a dedicated git-sync relay pod, service, and network policy.
  
### Bug fixes

- The Software UI now stores user tokens with `httpOnly` and `secure` flags.
- Fixed an issue where the Software UI would occasionally show an incorrect **Extra AU** number for Deployments. 
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

    - [CVE-2022-37601](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LOADERUTILS-3043105)
    - [CVE-2022-43680](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43680)
    - [CVE-2022-40674](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40674)
  
- Fixed an issue where you could not access Astronomer Software's Docker registry if you had access to more than 100 Deployments. 
- Fixed an issue where the Software UI did not show the correct last used dates for service accounts. 
- Fixed an issue where NATS would send false Deployment alert emails.
- Fixed an issue where the configuration in `astronomer.houston.updateRuntimeCheck.url` was ignored if not all supported Deployment image versions were present in the destination URL. 

## 0.30.8

Release date: September 15, 2023

### Additional improvements

- You can now configure credentials for a registry backend as Kubernetes secrets in your `values.yaml` file. See [Configure a registry backend](registry-backend.md).
- You can now disable Airflow and platform alerts on the Prometheus alerts dashboard by setting `prometheus.defaultAlerts.airflow.enabled` and `prometheus.defaultAlerts.airflow.enabled` to `false` in your Prometheus Helm chart. If you disable these alerts, you can still add back specific alerts or configure custom alerts using `prometheus.defaultAlerts.additionalAlerts`. See [Create custom alerts](platform-alerts.md#create-custom-alerts).
- You no longer have to set `elasticsearch.curator.age.timestring` when you configure a custom indexing pattern for [Vector logging sidecars](export-task-logs.md#export-logs-using-container-sidecars). The only required value is now `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.helm.loggingSidecar.indexPattern`. 
- You can now configure a service account specifically for your image registry using by setting `astronomer.registry.serviceaccount` in your `values.yaml` file. 
- The Kibana logging dashboard now includes a default index. 
- Added support for [Kubernetes 1.27](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/).

## 0.30.0

Release date: August 29, 2022

:::danger Breaking Change for Azure Database for PostgreSQL

A change in 0.30 enabled the `trgm` extension for PostgreSQL. If you use Azure Database for PostgreSQL as your database backend, you need to enable the `pg_trgm` extension before upgrading to Software 0.30 using either Azure portal or the Azure CLI. See [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-extensions) for configuration steps.

If you don't complete this setup before your upgrade, the upgrade will fail.

:::

### Improved token refreshing for IdP integrations

The Software UI now refreshes your JSON web token (JWT) based on the validity of your authentication token from your IdP. This means that as long as you stay logged in to your IdP, you no longer have to refresh the Software UI to continue accessing the Software UI, Astro CLI, and Houston API.

Additionally, if you change a user's access to Astronomer from your IdP, their permissions will be automatically updated in Astronomer after their current IdP token expires. If you remove a user completely from Astronomer, they are automatically logged out of the Software UI and CLI after their current IdP token expires.

As part of this change, you can now configure `jwt.authDuration` in your [Houston Helm configuration](https://github.com/astronomer/docs/blob/main/software_configs/0.30/default.yaml). If a user is logged on longer than `authDuration`, they will be immediately logged out regardless of the status of their JWT or authentication token.

### Additional improvements

- Workspace users are now paginated in the Software UI.
- You can now configure credentials for a private image registry by specifying a secret you create instead of a username and password. The secret is attached to any Pods that need to access the registry.
- You can now specify `authUrlParams` for your identity provider (IdP) in `values.yaml`.
- System Editors can no longer manage Teams or users in a Workspace. These permissions are now available only at the System Admin level.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where `updateRuntimeCheck.enabled:false` did not properly stop an Astronomer Software installation from checking for Runtime updates. 
- Fixed an issue where applying an IAM role to a Deployment would reset the Deployment's **Extra Capacity** setting back to the default of 0 AU.
- Fixed an issue where System Admins could receive an error when trying to view a Team imported from a different IdP than their current one.
- When a System Admin makes a change to a Team, that change now appears in the UI without needing to refresh the page.
- Configurations for disabling a specific executor type in `values.yaml` are now reflected in the Software UI.
- Fixed an issue where Workspace-level service accounts could view Deployment information from Deployments outside of their Workspace.
- Fixed an issue where updating the role of a user in a Team using the Astro CLI would not throw an error as expected.
- Fixed an issue where JSON web tokens persisted after a user logged out if `idpGroupsRefreshEnabled` was set to `false`.
- Users authenticating with Google Direct are no longer automatically logged out of Astronomer Software after 1 hour.

## 0.29.5

Release date: October 11, 2022

:::danger Breaking change

(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/65106) that occurs when you upgrade Helm charts that include duplicate keys in an `env` array. If you have a Helm chart with duplicate keys and upgrade to Astronomer Software 0.29.3+, all key-value pairs with the duplicate key are removed from your environment.

To preserve duplicate keys in your Helm chart, you can either reapply the values after upgrading, or you can use the `--reset-values` flag when you run the upgrade script as described in [Upgrade Astronomer](upgrade-astronomer.md).

:::

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where you couldn't run Houston API queries for Deployments using `releaseName` and `label`
- Fixed an issue where a user could not log in through Azure AD SSO if the user belonged to a group without a `displayName`

## 0.29.0

Release date: June 1, 2022

### Support for Astro Runtime images

You can now use Astro Runtime images in your Software Deployments. Additionally, you can now select Runtime images when setting **Image Version** for a Deployment in the Software UI.

Functionally, Runtime images are similar to Certified images. They both include:

- Same-day support for Apache Airflow releases
- Extended support lifecycles
- Regularly backported bug and security fixes

Astro Runtime includes additional features which are not available in Astronomer Certified images, including:

- The `astronomer-providers` package, which includes a set of operators that are built and maintained by Astronomer
- Airflow UI improvements, such as showing your Deployment's Docker image tag in the footer
- Features that are exclusive to Astro Runtime and coming soon, such as new Airflow components and improvements to the DAG development experience

To upgrade a Deployment to Runtime, follow the steps in [Upgrade Airflow](manage-airflow-versions.md), making sure to replace the Astronomer Certified image in your Dockerfile with an Astro Runtime version.

### Use a custom container image registry to deploy code

You can now configure a custom container image registry in place of Astronomer's default registry. This option is best suited for mature organizations who require additional control for security and governance reasons. Using a custom registry provides your organization with the opportunity to scan images for CVEs, malicious code, and approved/ unapproved Python and OS-level dependencies prior to deploying code. To configure this feature, see [Configure a custom image registry](custom-image-registry.md).

### Export task logs using logging sidecars

You can now configure logging sidecar containers to collect and export task logs to ElasticSearch. This exporting approach is best suited for organizations that use Astronomer Software in a multi-tenant cluster where security is a concern, as well as for organizations running many small tasks using the Kubernetes executor. To configure this feature, see [Export task logs](export-task-logs.md).

### Simplified configuration for namespace pools

The process for configuring namespace pools has been simplified. As an alternative to manually creating namespaces, you can now delegate the creation of each namespace, including roles and rolebindings, to Astronomer Software. While this feature is suitable for most use cases, you can still manually create namespaces if you want more fine-grained control over the namespace's resources and permissions. For more information, see [Namespace pools](namespace-pools.md).

### Additional improvements

- Added support for [Kubernetes 1.22](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/04/kubernetes-1-22-release-announcement/)
- Deprecated usage of [kubed](https://appscode.com/products/kubed/) for security and performance improvements
- Redis containers can now run as non-root users
- Added minimum security requirements for user passwords when using local auth
- You can now use Azure DevOps repos in your [Git sync](deploy-git-sync.md) configurations
- You can now disable all network policies for Airflow components using the Astronomer Helm chart
- System Admins can now view all Workspaces on their installation by default
- User auth tokens for the Software UI are now stored in httpOnly cookies
- When importing IdP groups as teams, you can now configure a `teamFilterRegex` in `values.yaml` to filter out IdP groups from being imported using regex
- Added support for audit logging when a user interacts with the Houston API. This includes actions within the Software UI

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue in Deployments running Airflow 2.3+ where logs for dynamically mapped tasks did not have a correct `log_id`
- Fixed a typo in the `loadBalancerIP` key in the Nginx Helm chart
- Fixed an issue where Azure AD connect sync did not work with Astronomer's Teams feature
- Fixed an issue where upgrades would fail if you had changed `networkNSLabels` from `true` to `false` in `values.yaml`

### Limit Workspace Creation to System Admins

To provide more control over resource usage across your organization, you can now limit the ability to create Workspaces only to users with System Admin permissions.

For more information about each role's permissions, including instructions for how to modify a role's permissions, see [Platform User Management](manage-platform-users.md).

### Additional improvements

- Added the `houston.config.deployments.enableSystemAdminCanCreateDeprecatedAirflows` configuration which enables System Admins to create Deployments with deprecated versions of Astronomer Certified

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed documentation links in the Software UI

## 0.27.1

Release date: January 10, 2022

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where users could not create Deployments via an IAM role

## 0.27.0

Release date: December 21, 2021

### Custom OAuth Flows

You can now configure a custom OAuth flow as an alternative to Astronomer's default implicit flow. You can customize Astronomer's existing Okta, Google, and GitHub OAuth flows, or you can import an entirely custom OAuth flow. For more information, read [Configure a Custom OAuth Flow](integrate-auth-system.md#configure-a-custom-oauth-flow).

### Deploy DAGs via Git Sync

You can now configure a Git repo to continually push DAGs to an Astronomer Deployment via git-sync. DAGs deployed via git-sync automatically appear in the Airflow UI without requiring additional action or causing downtime. For more information, read [Deploy DAGs via Git Sync](deploy-git-sync.md).

### External ElasticSearch Logging

Custom ElasticSearch logging tools are now supported via new values in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
# External ES logging
global:
  customLogging:
    enabled: true
    scheme: https
    host: ""
    port: ""
    secret: ""
    #secretName: ~
    #awsSecretName: ~
    #awsIAMRole: ~
    #awsServiceAccountAnnotation: ~
```

### CLI Support for Podman

By default, the Astronomer CLI uses Docker to execute a few specific commands. As an alternative, you can now configure the Astronomer CLI to use Podman instead. For more information, read [Run the CLI with Podman](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/use-podman).

### Bug Fixes

- Dropped support for Kubernetes 1.17
- Fixed an issue where redeployments could clobber existing annotations for namespaces
- Fixed an issue where new Deployments could potentially generate invalid usernames for Celery and the metadata DB
- Fixed an issue where scheduler, webserver, and worker logs were not accessible via the Astronomer CLI
- Fixed an issue where where setting extra volumes via `values.yaml` did not work when NFS DAG deploys were enabled.

## 0.26.7

Release date: March 1, 2022

### Additional improvements

- Fixed several CVEs
- Updated documentation links in the UI to point to Software documentation

## 0.26.6

Release date: January 10, 2022

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where users could not create Deployments via an IAM role

## 0.26.5

Release date: December 11, 2021

### Bug Fixes

- Remediated [CVE-2021-44228](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q) related to Log4J by setting ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true at runtime for all ElasticSearch containers

## 0.26.4

Release date: November 22, 2021

### Support for Airflow 2.2.0

[Apache Airflow 2.2.0](https://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-2.2.0/) is an exciting milestone in the open source project. Most notably, this release introduces custom timetables and deferrable operators.

#### Custom Timetables

Timetables are a powerful new framework that you can use to create custom schedules using Python. In an effort to provide more flexibility and address known limitations imposed by cron, timetables use an intuitive `data_interval` that, for example, allows you to schedule a DAG to run daily on Monday through Friday, but not on the weekend. Timetables can be easily plugged into existing DAGs, which means that it's easy to create your own or use community-developed timetables in your project.

For more information on using timetables, read the [Apache Airflow Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/timetable.html).

#### Deferrable Operators

Deferrable operators are a new type of Airflow operator that promises improved performance and lower resource costs. While standard operators and sensors take up a Worker or Scheduler slot even when they are waiting for an external trigger, deferrable operators are designed to suspend themselves and free up that Worker or Scheduler slot while they wait. This is made possible by a new, lightweight Airflow component called the Triggerer.

As part of supporting deferrable operators, you can provision multiple Triggerers on your Astronomer Deployments. By provisioning multiple Triggerers, you can ensure that tasks using Deferrable Operators are run even when one Triggerer goes down. For more information about configuring Triggerers and other resources, see [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment.md).

### CLI Verbosity Flag

You can now specify a `--verbosity` flag for all Astronomer CLI commands. When you specify this flag with a CLI command, the CLI prints out [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) logs as the command runs. This is useful for debugging any errors that might result from a CLI command.

The flag prints out different levels of logs depending on the value that you pass it. Each possible value (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, and `panic`) maps to a different Logrus logging level. For more information about these logging levels, read the [Logrus documentation](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus#level-logging).

### Minor Improvements

- You can now create a custom set of cluster-level permissions for the Astronomer Commander service by setting `astronomer.global.clusterRoles: false` in your `values.yaml` file and pushing a new [RoleBinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) to a pre-created Kubernetes namespace.
- In the `astronomer.houston.config` section of your `values.yaml` file, you can now configure a list of `allowedSystemLevelDomains []`. If you configure this list, only users with emails from domains specified in the list (for example, `<company>.com`) can be granted System Admin privileges.
- Greatly improved load times for the **System Admin** page in the UI.
- You can now specify a node port for 3rd party ingress controllers with a service type of `nodePort`.
- The naming format of service account pods has been changed from `<release-name>-dags-prod-worker-serviceaccount` to `release_name-dags-prod-airflow-worker`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where you could not update an existing Deployment's IAM role via the Astronomer CLI
- Fixed an issue where Deployments would not work on clusters with custom domains
- Fixed error handling when interacting with a Deployment that wasn't fully spun up
- Added a new validation step for Airflow Helm chart values configured in the `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.helm.airflow` section of `values.yaml`
