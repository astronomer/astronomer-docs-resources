<!--version-specific-->

This document lists all available versions of Astronomer Software documentation, organized by their current support status.

While only maintained documentation sets appear under the Astronomer Software documentation menu, Astronomer preserves all versions for historical reference. The support timeline for a given set of documentation is the same as the support timeline for the corresponding version of Astronomer Software.

For more information about Software version support, see [Release and lifecycle policy](release-lifecycle-policy.md).

## Documentation maintenance policy

This includes critical content fixes and updates based on bug fixes and minor features. These documentation sets, however, are not updated with enhanced content and quality-of-life improvements.
