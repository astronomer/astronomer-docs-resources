The Astro CLI is the easiest way to run Apache Airflow on your machine. From the Astro CLI, you can run a local Apache Airflow environment with a dedicated webserver, scheduler and Postgres database. Once you create an Astronomer Software project, you can customize it (for example, add Python or OS-level packages or add plugins) and test it on your local machine.

You can also use the CLI to:

- Authenticate to Astronomer Software.
- List the Astro Workspace and Deployments you can access.
- Deploy a project to Software.

## Install the Astro CLI

    values={[
        {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
        {label: 'Windows with winget', value: 'windowswithwinget'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="mac">

#### Prerequisites

To use the Astro CLI on Mac, you must have:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v18.09 or higher).

#### Installation

To install the latest version of the Astro CLI, run the following command:

```sh
brew install astro
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

#### Prerequisites

To use the Astro CLI on Windows, you must have:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) for Windows.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v1.13.1 or higher).
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) enabled on your local machine.
-  Windows 10 or Windows 11.

#### Installation

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases) of the Astro CLI GitHub repository, scroll to a CLI version, and then download the `.exe` file that matches the CPU architecture of your machine.

    For example, to install v1.0.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows machine with an AMD 64 architecture, download `astro_1.0.0-converged_windows_amd64.exe`.

2. Rename the file to `astro.exe`.

3. Add the filepath for the directory containing the new `astro.exe` as a PATH environment variable. For example, if `astro.exe` is stored in `C:\Users\username\astro.exe`, you add `C:\Users\username` as your PATH environment variable. To learn more about configuring the PATH environment variable, see [How do I set or change the PATH system variable?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

4. Restart your machine.

<TabItem value="windowswithwinget">

Starting with Astro CLI version 1.6, you can use the Windows Package Manager winget command-line tool to install the Astro CLI. To install an older version of the Astro CLI, you'll need to follow the [alternate Windows installation process](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/install-cli?tab=windows#install-the-astro-cli).

The winget command line tool is supported on Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later, and is bundled with Windows 11 and modern versions of Windows 10 by default as the App Installer. If you're running an earlier version of Windows 10 and you don't have the App Installer installed, you can download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1?hl=en-ca&gl=ca). If you've installed the App Installer previously, make sure you're using the latest version before running commands.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) for Windows.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v1.13.1 or later).
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) enabled on your local machine.
- Astro CLI version 1.6 or later.
- The latest version of the Windows [App Installer](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1?hl=en-ca&gl=ca).
- Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later or Windows 11.

#### Installation

Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator and then run the following command:

```sh
winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro
```

To install a specific version of the Astro CLI, specify the version you want to install at the end of the command. For example, running the following command installs Astro CLI version 1.6:

```sh
winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro -v 1.6.0
```

#### Prerequisites

To use the Astro CLI on Linux, you must have:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v1.13.1 or higher).

#### Installation

Run the following command to install the latest version of the Astro CLI directly to `PATH`:

```sh
curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Confirm the install

To confirm the CLI was installed properly, run the following CLI command:

```
astro version
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the following output:

```sh
astro version
Astro CLI Version: {{CLI_VER_LATEST}}
```

## Upgrade the CLI

<Tabs
    defaultValue="mac"
    groupId= "upgrade-the-cli"
    values={[
        {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="mac">

To upgrade the Astro CLI to the latest version, run the following command:

```sh
brew install astro
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

To upgrade the Astro CLI on Windows:

1. Delete the existing `astro.exe` file on your machine.

2. Go to the [**Releases** page of the Astro CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases). Based on the version of the CLI you want and your CPU architecture, download one of the `.zip` files available in the **Assets** menu.

     For example, to upgrade to v1.0.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows machine with an AMD 64 architecture, you download `astro_1.0.0-converged_windows_amd64.zip`.

3. If the `.zip` file isn't automatically extracted, run the following command to extract the executable:

    ```sh
    tar -xvzf .\astrocli.tar.gz
    ```

4. Add the filepath for the directory containing the new `astro.exe` as a PATH environment variable. For example, if `astro.exe` was stored in `C:\Users\username\astro.exe`, you would add `C:\Users\username` as your PATH environment variable. To learn more about configuring the PATH environment variable, see [Java documentation](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

5. Restart your machine.
