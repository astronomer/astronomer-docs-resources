Astro Runtime is a production ready, data orchestration tool based on Apache Airflow that is distributed as a Docker image and is required by all Astronomer products. It is intended to provide organizations with improved functionality, reliability, efficiency, and performance.

Deploying Astro Runtime is a requirement if your organization is using Astro. Astro Runtime includes the following features:

- Timely support for new patch, minor, and major versions of Apache Airflow. This includes bug fixes that have not been released by the open source project but are backported to Astro Runtime and available to users earlier.
- Exclusive features to enrich the task execution experience, including smart task concurrency defaults and high availability configurations.
- The `openlineage-airflow` package. [OpenLineage](https://openlineage.io/) standardizes the definition of data lineage, the metadata that forms lineage metadata, and how data lineage metadata is collected from external systems. This package enables data lineage on Astro. See [OpenLineage and Airflow](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/airflow-openlineage/).
- A custom Airflow UI that includes links to Astronomer resources and exposes the currently running Docker image tag in the footer of all UI pages.
- A custom logging module that ensures Airflow task logs are reliably available to the Astro data plane. (_Astro only_).
- A custom security manager that enforces user roles and permissions as defined by Astro. (_Astro only_).
- A monitoring DAG that the Astronomer team uses to monitor the health of Astro Deployments. (_Astro only_)

For more information about the features that are available in Astro Runtime releases, see the [Astro Runtime release notes](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/runtime-release-notes).

## Runtime versioning

Astro Runtime versions are released regularly and use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Astronomer ships major, minor, and patch releases of Astro Runtime in the format of `major.minor.patch`.

- **Major** versions are released for significant feature additions. This includes new major or minor versions of Apache Airflow, as well as API or DAG specification changes that are not backward compatible.
- **Minor** versions are released for functional changes. This includes API or DAG specification changes that are backward compatible, which might include new minor versions of `astronomer-providers` and `openlineage-airflow`.
- **Patch** versions are released for bug and security fixes that resolve unwanted behavior. This includes new patch versions of Apache Airflow, `astronomer-providers`, and `openlineage-airflow`.

Every version of Astro Runtime correlates to an Apache Airflow version. All Deployments must run only one version of Astro Runtime, but you can run different versions of Astro Runtime on different Deployments within a given cluster or Workspace.

For a list of supported Astro Runtime versions and more information on the Astro Runtime maintenance policy, see [Astro Runtime versioning and lifecycle policy](runtime-version-lifecycle-policy).

For version compatibility information, see the [Runtime release notes](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/runtime-release-notes).

### Docker Registry URLs

Airflow 2.x images are still available under the original registry:
```
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:{{2.x_RUNTIME_VER}}
```
but can also be pulled from the new domain as an alternative:
```
astrocrpublic.azurecr.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:{{2.x_RUNTIME_VER}}
```

## Default environment variables

The following table lists the Airflow environment variables that have different default values on Astro Runtime as of version {{2.x_RUNTIME_VER}}. Unlike [global environment variables](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/platform-variables) set on the Astro data plane, you can override the values of these variables for specific use cases.

### Provider package versioning

If an Astro Runtime release includes changes to an installed version of a provider package that is maintained by Astronomer (`astronomer-providers` or `openlineage-airflow`), the version change is documented in the [Astro Runtime release notes](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/runtime-release-notes).

To determine the version of any provider package installed in your current Astro Runtime image, run:

```
docker run --rm <runtime-image> pip freeze | grep <provider>
```

For example, to find the version of the current package for Astronomer providers, run the following command:

```
astro dev bash pip freeze | grep astronomer-providers
```

## Python versioning
| Astro Runtime | Apache Airflow version | Default Python version | Supported Python versions |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| 4             | 2.2                    | 3.9                    | 3.9               |
| 5             | 2.3                    | 3.9                    | 3.9               |
| 6             | 2.4                    | 3.9                    | 3.9               |
| 7             | 2.5                    | 3.9                    | 3.9               |
| 8             | 2.6                    | 3.10                   | 3.10              |
| 9             | 2.7                    | 3.11                   | 3.9 - 3.11        |
| 10            | 2.8                    | 3.11                   | 3.9 - 3.11        |
| 11            | 2.9                    | 3.11                   | 3.9 - 3.11        |
| 12            | 2.10                   | 3.12                   | 3.10 - 3.12       |
| 13            | 2.11                   | 3.12                   | 3.10 - 3.12       |

Starting with Astro Runtime 9, if you require a different version of Python than what's included in the base distribution, you can use a Python distribution of Astro Runtime. See [Distribution](#distribution).

If you're running Astro Runtime 6.0 (based on Airflow 2.4) to Runtime 8, Astronomer recommends that you use the `ExternalPythonOperator` to run different Python versions in Airflow. See [ExternalPythonOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/operator/python.html#externalpythonoperator).

If you're currently using the `KubernetesPodOperator` or the `PythonVirtualenvOperator` in your DAGs, you can continue to use them to create virtual or isolated environments that can run tasks with different versions of Python.

### Python version considerations

Starting with Python version 3.12, Python has removed the module `imp`. This can cause errors for your DAGs if you Astro Runtime version 12 or higher, which supports Python Version 3.12 or higher.

See [How do I migrate from `imp`](https://discuss.python.org/t/how-do-i-migrate-from-imp/27885) guidance from Python for remediation steps.
If you're currently using the `KubernetesPodOperator` or the `PythonVirtualenvOperator` in your DAGs, you can continue to use them to create virtual or isolated environments that can run tasks with different versions of Python.

## Postgres version compatibility

The following table shows which versions Postgres are compatible with each version of Astro Runtime. Note that Postgres versioning is handled automatically on Astro Hosted.

| Astro Runtime | Apache Airflow version | Postgres versions |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| 5             | 2.3                    | 10-13             |
| 6             | 2.4                    | 10-13             |
| 7             | 2.5                    | 11-15             |
| 8             | 2.6                    | 11-15             |
| 9             | 2.7                    | 11-15             |
| 10            | 2.8                    | 12-16             |
| 11            | 2.9                    | 12-16             |
| 12            | 2.10                   | 12-16             |
| 13            | 2.11                   | 12-16             |

## Executors

In Airflow, the executor is responsible for determining how and where a task is completed.

In all local environments created with the Astro CLI, Astro Runtime runs the [Local executor](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/local.html). On Astro and Astronomer Software, you can use either the Celery executor or the Kubernetes executor.

## Image types

Astro Runtime is distributed as a Debian-based Docker image. An Astro Runtime image must be specified in the `Dockerfile` of your Astro project. The default image tag is:

```
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<version>
```

You can modify this image tag in your Astro project Dockerfile to use different versions of Astro Runtime. The following sections explain each image type and how to specify them. For a list of all Astro Runtime Docker images, see [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/astronomer/astro-runtime?tab=tags).

### Base images

The base Astro Runtime Docker image has the following format:

```
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<version>-base
```

A `base` Astro Runtime image is recommended for complex use cases that require additional customization, such as [installing Python packages from private sources](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/private-python-packages).

For all other cases, Astronomer recommends using non-`base` images, which incorporate ONBUILD commands that copy and scaffold your Astro project directory so you can more easily pass those files to the images running each core Airflow component.

### Python version images

Starting with Astro Runtime 9, Astronomer maintains different Astro Runtime images for each [supported Python version](#python-versioning). Python version images have the following format:

```text
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<runtime-version>-python-<python-version>
```

### Slim images

Starting with Astro Runtime 11, Astronomer maintains a slim Astro Runtime image. Slim Astro Runtime images only include the dependencies required for the basic functionality of Astro. Providers marked with an asterisk (\*) are also installed by default on open source Apache Airflow. The providers installed in the slim image are:

- Common IO [`apache-airflow-providers-common-io`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-common-io/)\*
- Common SQL [`apache-airflow-providers-common-sql`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-common-sql/)\*
- FAB [`apache-airflow-providers-fab`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-fab/)\*
- FTP [`apache-airflow-providers-ftp`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-ftp/)\*
- HTTP [`apache-airflow-providers-http`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-http/)\*
- IMAP [`apache-airflow-providers-imap`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-imap/)\*
- SMTP [`apache-airflow-providers-smtp`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-smtp/)\*
- SQLite [`apache-airflow-providers-sqlite`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-sqlite/)\*
- Celery [`apache-airflow-providers-celery`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-celery/)
- Elasticsearch [`apache-airflow-providers-elasticsearch`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-elasticsearch/)
- MySQL [`apache-airflow-providers-mysql`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-mysql/)
- PostgreSQL (Postgres) [`apache-airflow-providers-postgres`](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-postgres/)
- `astronomer-kubernetes-executor`

Use the slim Astro Runtime image if you want faster local builds and deploys, smaller footprint for security vulnerabilities and dependency conflicts, or you don't require the packages included in the default Astro Runtime distribution.

### Combine image types

Image types are additive, meaning that you can combine multiple types in your image tag to specify an image with multiple variations.

Types must be specified in a specific order in your image tag. The order and format multi-type image tag is:

```
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:<astro-runtime-version>-<python-version-type>-<slim-type>-<base-type>
```

You can add or remove any types as needed. For example, to use the base, slim Astro Runtime image with Python 3.11, your image tag would be:

```
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:11.0.0-python-3.11-slim-base
```

If you wanted the same base image using Python 3.11, but you didn't want it to be slim, you would remove the `-slim-` from the image tag like in the following example:

```
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:11.0.0-python-3.11-base
```

## System distribution

The following table lists the operating systems and architectures supported by each Astro Runtime version.

| Astro Runtime | Apache Airflow version | Operating System (OS)                | Architecture    |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- |

| 11            | 2.9                    | Debian 11.8 (bullseye), RHEL UBI 9¹² | AMD64 and ARM64 |
| 12            | 2.10                   | Debian 12 (bookworm), RHEL UBI 9¹³ | AMD64 and ARM64 |
| 13            | 2.10                   | Debian 12 (bookworm), RHEL UBI 9 | AMD64 and ARM64 |


¹ RHEL UBI 9 images are officially supported starting with Astro Runtime 12.5.0 in the 12.x series, and available experimentally starting with Astro Runtime 11.13.0 in the 11.x series. \
² Astro Runtime 11.13.0 and later support RHEL UBI 9. \
³ Astro Runtime 12.3.0 and later support RHEL UBI 9.

Astro Runtime 6.0.4 and later images are multi-arch and support AMD64 and ARM64 processor architectures for local development. Docker automatically uses the correct processor architecture based on the computer you are using.
