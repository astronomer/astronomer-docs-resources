description: Access Airflow's Postgres Metadata Database on Astronomer Software.

---

## Overview

On Astronomer, each Airflow deployment is equipped with a PostgreSQL database that serves as Airflow's underlying metadata database and your Airflow Scheduler's source of truth.

On Astronomer Software, a Postgres Metadata database will be created for each individual Airflow Deployment and hosted within your wider Platform Database.

This guide will cover guidelines for the following:

- Risks associated with and use cases for Database Access
- Access to Airflow's Database in Local Development
- Decode Astronomer's Metadata Secret
- Access to Airflow's Database on Astronomer
- Example DAG that incorporates a query to the database

> **Note:** Airflow's "Ad-Hoc Query" feature used to be a common way to test DB connections and query the Airflow Metadata Database via the Airflow UI but was deprecated in 1.10 for security reasons.

### Risk Associated with Database Access

As noted above, every Airflow Deployment's Metadata Database on Astronomer is hosted within the Platform Database your team initiated during the install process for Astronomer Software. Given its importance to the Scheduler's performance, it's worth noting the risks associated with accessing Airflow's Database.

We strongly recommend users do not write to the database directly as it can compromise both the integrity of your Airflow Deployment and both of our team's ability to support a user in the case of an issue.

### Use Cases

Keeping the above risk in mind, pulling from and reading the database safely can be a great way to gather metadata from your Airflow Deployment that isn't otherwise exposed on Astronomer and Airflow (yet).

A few examples of what you can query for:
- Completed Task Count
- Tasks started per hour, per week
- Task duration

Read below for DB access guidelines both locally and on Astronomer.

## Local Access to the Airflow Database

To successfully query from your Airflow Deployment's Database, you'll need to set up your local Postgres connection.

**1. Find the `airflow_db` Connection Object**

On the Airflow UI, navigate over to `Admin` > `Connections`.

The `airflow_db` connection is generated by default.

![Connections Page](/img/software/query-postgres-connection-page.png)

**2. Edit the Connection**

In the `airflow_db` connection object:

- Change the `Conn Type` to `Postgres`
- Add the following connection information:

    ```
    host: postgres
    schema: postgres
    login: postgres
    password: postgres
    port (optional): 5432
    ```
Your connection should look something like:

![Local Connections Details Page](/img/software/query-postgres-connection-details.png)

The port will be set to 5342 by default but if you’ve set a custom port, you’ll need to update that here as well.

**3. Connect to `airflow_db` in your DAG**

Here's an example DAG, where `postgres_conn_id` is set to `airflow_db`:

```py
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.hooks.postgres_hook import PostgresHook
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta


def get_dag_ids():
    postgres_hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id="airflow_db")
    records = postgres_hook.get_records(sql="select dag_id from dag")
    print(records)


with DAG(
    "example_dag",
    start_date=datetime(2019, 1, 1),
    max_active_runs=1,
    schedule_interval=None,
    # catchup=False # enable if you don't want historical dag runs to run
) as dag:

    t1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="get_dag_nums",
        python_callable=get_dag_ids,
        sql="select dag_id from dag",
        postgres_conn_id="airflow_db",
    )
```

Here, the task above grabs all `dag_ids` stored inside `dag` Table within Airflow's Metadata Database.

### Connect to the DB via a PostgreSQL Client

With the connection information above, you should also be able to connect to the Airflow Database from any PostgreSQL client.

Using [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/app-psql.html), a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL, run:

```
psql -h localhost -U postgres -p 5432 -W
```

When prompted, enter the password from the Connection Object above to access the database.

Alternatively, you can also connect to the DB via the Postgres container itself by exec-ing into it and executing the `psql` command.

To do so, run:

```
docker exec -it <postgres_container_id> /bin/bash

psql -U postgres
```

## Access to the Airflow Database on Astronomer

The easiest way to pull from Airflow's Metadata Database on Astronomer is to leverage the `AIRFLOW_CONN_AIRFLOW_DB` Environment Variable, which we set [here](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow-chart/blob/master/templates/_helpers.yaml#L16-L20).

This Environment Variable, which we set by default, silently enables users to leverage the `airflow_db` connection. It's worth noting that the connection itself in the Airflow UI will NOT reflect the correct credentials (Conn Type, Host, Schema, Login, Password, Port).

To pull from the Airflow Database, follow the steps below. Note that you do _not_ have to set this Environment Variable yourself and you do _not_ have to populate the `airflow_db` connection in the Airflow UI.

**1. Leave your `airflow_db` Connection as is**

Your `airflow_db` connection by default will look like the following:

```
Conn Id: airflow_db
Conn Type: MySQL
Host: mysql
Schema: airflow
Login: root
```

While this information is incorrect in the Airflow UI, the underlying connection will still succeed, as connections set by an Environment Variable take precedence over connection details in the Software UI and in the Metadata Database itself.

For clarity, we intend to make sure this connection is properly populated in upcoming versions of Astronomer.

**2. Call `airflow_db` in your DAG**

You can use the same example DAG outlined above where `postgres_conn_id` is set to `airflow_db`.

**3. Verify the Connection in your Task Logs**

To verify a successful connection, you can inspect the corresponding task log -

```

In these logs, you can see that the connection info is properly passed:

```

```

## Decode the Airflow Metadata Secret on Astronomer

On Astronomer, your deployment's Postgres credentials are also stored as a [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#overview-of-secrets) (`airflow-metadata`) in your deployment's [Kubernetes namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/). For users with `kubectl` access to the cluster who want to properly populate the `airflow_db` connection in the Airflow UI with the proper credentials, follow our instructions below.

> **Note:** This is entirely optional and is not required, as the `AIRFLOW_CONN_AIRFLOW_DB` Environment Variable is pre-set on Astronomer and will allow users to reference the `airflow_db` connection in a DAG even though the connection itself isn't populated in the Airflow UI.

### Pre-Requisites

- Access to your Kubernetes Cluster with permissions to:
    - List Namespaces
    - List Pods
    - List Kubernetes Secrets
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) (*optional*)

### Pull Postgres Credentials via Kubectl

**1. Switch into your Kubernetes Cluster**

The rest of this guide will assume the use of [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) - a command line tool that allows you to easily switch between Kubernetes Clusters and Namespaces.

To start, switch into the Kubernetes Cluster that hosts Astronomer Software.

```
kubectx
```

**2. List the Namespaces in your Cluster**

To list the namespaces on your Kubernetes cluster, run:

```
kubens
```

**3. Confirm your Deployment's Corresponding Namespace**

Find the Kubernetes Namespace that corresponds to the Airflow deployment whose database you'd like credentials to and run:

```
kubens <NAMESPACE>
```

Then, run:

```
kubectl get pods
```

You should see something like:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
quasaric-sun-9051-flower-7bbdf98d94-zxxjd           1/1     Running   0          93d
quasaric-sun-9051-2346-pgbouncer-c997bbd9d-dgsjr    2/2     Running   0          2d
quasaric-sun-9051-2346-redis-0                      1/1     Running   0          93d
quasaric-sun-9051-2346-scheduler-59f856bd5-d7gl4    1/1     Running   0          3h
quasaric-sun-9051-2346-statsd-5c7d7b6777-x7v4x      1/1     Running   0          93d
quasaric-sun-9051-2346-webserver-56fb447559-gjg8n   1/1     Running   0          3h
quasaric-sun-9051-2346-worker-0                     2/2     Running   0          3h
```

On every Astronomer Deployment, you'll see a Kubernetes Pod for each component - the combination of which depends on the Airflow Executor running in that deployment.

The example above assumes the Celery Executor and so includes an additional component for a Celery Worker, a [Redis](https://redis.io/) queue and [Flower](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) dashboard.

**4. Get Secret**

As a next step, you'll have to pull one of multiple Kubernetes Secrets for the Kubernetes Namespace in which your Airflow Deployment lives.

To list those secrets, run:

```
kubectl get secret
```

You'll see something like the following:

```
$ kubectl get secret
NAME                                                              TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-fk86l                                               kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-airflow-metadata                       Opaque                                1      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-airflow-result-backend                 Opaque                                1      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-broker-url                             Opaque                                1      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-env                                    Opaque                                0      92d
geocentric-instrument-2346-fernet-key                             Opaque                                1      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-pgbouncer-config                       Opaque                                2      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-pgbouncer-stats                        Opaque                                1      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-redis-password                         Opaque                                1      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-registry                               kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson        1      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-scheduler-serviceaccount-token-w29bn   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      93d
geocentric-instrument-2346-airflow-worker-token-gqr4w             kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      93d
```

The secret we're looking for lives in that "airflow-metadata" pod (for Airflow's Metadata database).

Now, run:

```
kubectl get secret <airflow metadata pod>
```

Next, run:

```
kubectl get secret <airflow metadata pod> -o yaml
```

This will pull some metadata on the secret itself, including an encoded "connection" string.

```
apiVersion: v1
data:
  connection: cG9zdGdyZXNxbDovL2dlb2NlbnRyaWNfaW5zdHJ1bWVudF8yMzQ2X2FpcmZsb3c6VTJvN3F2VnVsWnZ5cXl2V1hXbTBSSGh1UHlqdk1IT3BAZ2VvY2VudHJpYy1pbnN0cnVtZW50LTIzNDYtcGdib3VuY2VyOjY1NDMvZ2VvY2VudHJpYy1pbnN0cnVtZW50LTIzNDYtbWV0YWRhdGE=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-05-02T09:06:11Z"
  labels:
    chart: airflow
    heritage: Tiller
    release: geocentric-instrument-2346
    workspace: 484c967e-4ec1-4b36-8536-1525813028e1
  name: geocentric-instrument-2346-airflow-metadata
  namespace: astronomer-cloud-geocentric-instrument-2346
  resourceVersion: "47818384"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/astronomer-cloud-geocentric-instrument-2346/secrets/geocentric-instrument-2346-airflow-metadata
  uid: a84029d3-0e6d-12e8-b31a-42010a96009f
type: Opaque
```

**6. Decode the Secret**

Now, let's grab the "connection" string from the top of that output and decode it:

```
echo "<connectionstring>" | base64 --decode
```

You'll get something like the following (don't worry, this is a sample deployment):

```
postgresql://quasaric_sun_9051_airflow:U2o7qvVulGvyqyvAXWm0RPhuPvjvlHOp@quasaric-sun-9051-pgbouncer:6543echo /quasaric-sun-9051-metadata
```

**7. Save your Credentials**

Based on the output above, you can find the connection credentials you're looking for in the following format: `login:password@host:port/schema`

In this example, that'd be:

```
- Host: quasaric-sun-9051-pgbouncer
- Schema: quasaric-sun-9051-metadata
- Login: quasaric_sun_9051_airflow
- Password: U2o7qvVulGvyqyvAXWm0RPhuPvjvlHOp
- Port: 6543
```

**8. Update and Confirm your Connection**

To finish creating and confirming your connection, enter the credentials from Step 7 into the `airflow_db` connection in the Airflow UI.

If you want to store this connection and access it programmatically, you're also free to store it in a [Secret Backend](secrets-backend.md).
