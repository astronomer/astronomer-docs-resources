### Bug fixes

- Disabled the **Pause** button for `astronomer_monitoring_dag`, which cannot be disabled and helps the Astronomer team monitor the health of your Deployment.

## Astro Runtime 4.0.7

- Release date: December 15, 2021
- Airflow version: 2.2.2

### Astronomer monitoring DAG

Astro Runtime 4.0.7 includes a monitoring DAG that is pre-installed in the Docker image and enabled for all customers. In addition to existing Deployment health and metrics functionality, this DAG allows the Astronomer team to better monitor the health of your data plane by enabling real-time visibility into whether your workers are healthy and tasks are running.

The `astronomer_monitoring_dag` runs a simple bash task every 5 minutes to ensure that your Airflow scheduler and workers are functioning as expected. If the task fails twice in a row or is not scheduled within a 10-minute interval, Astronomer support receives an alert and will work with you to troubleshoot.

Because this DAG is essential to Astro's managed service, your organization will not be charged for its task runs. For the same reasons, this DAG can't be modified or disabled via the Airflow UI. To modify how frequently this DAG runs, you can specify an alternate schedule as a cron expression by setting `AIRFLOW_MONITORING_DAG_SCHEDULE_INTERVAL` as an environment variable.

## Astro Runtime 4.0.6

## Astro Runtime 4.0.0

- Release date: October 12, 2021
- Airflow version: 2.2.0

### Support for Airflow 2.2.0

Astro Runtime 4.0.0 is a significant release that supports and enhances [Apache Airflow 2.2.0](https://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-2.2.0/), an exciting milestone in the open source project. Most notably, this release introduces custom timetables and deferrable operators.

#### Custom timetables

Timetables represent a powerful new framework that allows Airflow users to create custom schedules using Python. In an effort to provide more flexibility and address known limitations imposed by cron, timetables use an intuitive `data_interval` that, for example, allows you to schedule a DAG to run daily on Monday through Friday, but not on the weekend. Timetables can be easily plugged into existing DAGs, which means that it's easy to create your own or use community-developed timetables in your project.

In addition to supporting the timetables framework, the team at Astronomer has built a `TradingHoursTimetable` that's ready to use in Runtime 4.0.0. You can use this timetable to run a DAG based on whether or not a particular global market is open for trade.

For more information on using timetables, read the [Apache Airflow Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/timetable.html).

#### Deferrable operators

[Deferrable operators](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/deferring.html) are a new type of Airflow operator that promises improved performance and lower resource costs. While standard operators and sensors take up a worker slot even when they are waiting for an external trigger, deferrable operators are designed to suspend themselves and free up that worker slot while they wait. This is made possible by a new, lightweight Airflow component called the triggerer.

Existing Airflow operators have to be re-written according to the deferrable operator framework. In addition to supporting those available in the open source project, Astronomer has built an exclusive collection of deferrable operators in Runtime 4.0.0. This collection includes the `DatabricksSubmitRunOperator`, the `DatabricksRunNowOperator`, and the `ExternalTaskSensor`. These are designed to be drop-in replacements for corresponding operators currently in use.

As part of supporting deferrable operators, the triggerer is now available as a fully managed component on Astro. This means that you can start using deferrable operators in your DAGs as soon as you're ready. For more general information on deferrable operators, as well as how to use Astronomer's exclusive deferrable operators, read [Deferrable operators](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/deferrable-operators).
