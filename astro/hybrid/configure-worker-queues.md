Astro Hybrid worker type setup

On Astro Hybrid clusters, worker type is defined as a node instance type that is supported by the cloud provider of your cluster. For example, a worker type might be `m5.2xlarge` or `c6i.4xlarge` for a Deployment running on a Hybrid AWS cluster hosted on your cloud. Actual worker size is equivalent to the total capacity of the worker type minus Astroâ€™s system overhead.

Your Organization can enable up to 10 additional different worker types for each Hybrid cluster. After a worker type is enabled on an Astro Hybrid cluster, the worker type becomes available to any Deployment in that cluster and appears in the **Worker Type** menu of the Astro UI.

1. Review the list of supported worker types for your cloud provider. See [AWS](resource-reference-aws-hybrid.md#supported-worker-node-pool-instance-types), [Azure](resource-reference-azure-hybrid.md#supported-worker-node-pool-instance-types), or [GCP resource references](resource-reference-gcp-hybrid.md#supported-worker-node-pool-instance-types).
2. Contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/open-support-request) and provide the following information:

    - The name of your cluster.
    - The name of the worker type(s) you want to enable for your cluster. For example, `m6i.2xlarge`.
